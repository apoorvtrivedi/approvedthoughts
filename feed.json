Housed in a plinth, it&#39;s grown on top of an electrode mesh that connects it to twenty large brass plates placed around the room. Visitors can listen as the brain fires off electrical pulses that trigger a transducer and a mallet behind each plate, striking them to produce sound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> Is this art?

Profit-maximizing firms already charge what the market will bear. If Costco’s volume justifies a discount, that doesn’t mean suppliers can or should charge higher prices to other buyers. Yes, there are models where costs change with volume but costs could go down with volume and, in any case, those models don’t rely on the folk theory of “making up the difference.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/07/ais-and-spontaneous-order.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AIs and Spontaneous Order</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This isn’t to say AI won’t help improve economic policy—it might, if we listen.

It’s the closest thing the bartending industry has to a canonical list of cocktails, akin to the American Kennel Club’s registry of dog breeds or a jazz musician’s Real Book of standards.\nAs of 2025, there are 102 IBA official cocktails, and as of July 12, 2025, I’ve had every one of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> Legend.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/collections/how-the-system-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How the System Works</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> An essay series on the hidden mechanisms that support modern life — and what happens if we don’t maintain them </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> This should be amazing.

We already have a going list of agentic, thoughtful, high-achieving families whose kids are close to our kids in age; as our kids get older, we’ll start organizing gatherings for families in this network where our kids can hang out and get to know each other (trips, summer camps, discord servers, study groups, etc.). As our kids reach their late teens and early 20s, we’ll begin organizing modern versions of the London Season—a series of events and gatherings at which our single kids ready for marriage can meet, mix, and get to know each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> Did not see this coming.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8179z199vo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Babies made using three people&#39;s DNA are born free of hereditary disease</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eight babies have been born in the UK using genetic material from three people to prevent devastating and often fatal conditions, doctors say.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The method, pioneered by UK scientists, combines the egg and sperm from a mum and dad with a second egg from a donor woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/07/the-sputnik-vs-deep-seek-moment-the-answers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Sputnik vs. Deep Seek Moment: The Answers</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I pointed out that the US response to Sputnik was fierce competition. Following Sputnik, we increased funding for education, especially math, science and foreign languages, organizations like ARPA were spun up, federal funding for R&amp;D was increased, immigration rules were loosened, foreign talent was attracted and tariff barriers continued to fall. In contrast, the response to what I called the “DeepSeek” moment has been nearly the opposite. Why did Sputnik spark investment while DeepSeek sparks retrenchment?

In the first two pages I found this: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uber’s current profits decrease by 0.50% of gross revenue. This probably does not mean that Uber is hurt, but rather that it is willing to forgo current profits to increase rider surplus—the right choice if it believes that long-run shareholder value is more closely tied to rider surplus and customer retention than to current profits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Makes sense. After this my eyes glazed over and I dropped the paper in Claude and asked it why drivers would participate in this. Here&#39;s what it says: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> The paper acknowledges this is the more problematic finding. &quot;My findings suggest that drivers might have good reason to complain. Their hourly earnings are not much higher than the minimum wage, so even the small effects I find might be a concern.&quot; </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, drivers may not have full information about the counterfactual (uniform pricing), and many drivers are part-time workers using Uber for supplemental income rather than as their primary employment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>",

There is plenty of alpha out there, if you know where and how to look. Also, brute force is underrated. Sadly behind a paywall and there&#39;s lot more to it than the gist below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Texas, as in many states, most people who play the lottery go to a store with a machine, choose numbers, then walk away with a ticket. Back in 2023, Texas also allowed online lottery-ticket vendors to set up shops to print tickets for their customers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Marantelli’s team recruited one such seller, struggling startup Lottery.com, to help with the logistics of buying and printing the millions of tickets. Like all lotto retailers, it would collect a 5% sales commission. The Texas Lottery Commission allowed dozens of the terminals that print tickets to be delivered to the four workshops set up by the team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That April 19, the commission announced that there had been no winner in that day’s drawing. The next drawing, with an even larger pot, would be three days later, on a Saturday. The group sprang into action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The printing operation ran day and night. The team had converted each number combination into a QR code. Crew members scanned the codes into the terminals using their phones, then scrambled to organize all the tickets in boxes such that they could easily locate the winning numbers. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The game called for picking six numbers from 1 to 54. For a pro gambler, some sets of numbers—such as 1,2,3,4,5,6—aren’t worth picking because so many other players choose them, which would split the pot. Marantelli’s operation bought 99.3% of the possibilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Money moved to Lottery.com from Ranogajec’s accounts—held under the name John Wilson—in the Isle of Man, a tax haven off the U.K. coast, taking a circuitous route via an escrow account at a Detroit law firm, according to people familiar with the transfers and bank statements reviewed by the Journal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The crew hit the jackpot that Saturday. One of their tickets was the sole winner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.palladiummag.com/2025/04/18/the-moon-should-be-a-computer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Moon Should Be a Computer</a>: Love the ambition. So much fun to read. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are other reasons to build a Moon computer, including to avoid the regulatory hurdles to build the energy centers needed to power centralized AI clusters and as a sovereignty play in the increasingly fraught geopolitical game on the road to developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—a system with the ability to solve virtually any cognitive task a human can. We of, course, don’t have to mine the Moon just to replicate a single human mind, but we might have to do so to power superintelligence, same in kind but vastly superior to our own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> How bad are these regulations exactly?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/04/12/how-i-made-a-useful-ai-assistant-with-one-sqlite-table-and-a-handful-of-cron-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stevens: a hackable AI assistant</a> via <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/13/stevens/#atom-everything\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simon Willison</a>: So many cool projects, so little time. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The assistant is called Stevens, named after the butler in the great Ishiguro novel Remains of the Day.

All written up nice and formally, just like you’d expect from a proper butler.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beyond the daily brief, we can communicate with Stevens on-demand—we can forward an email with some important info, or just leave a reminder or ask a question via Telegram chat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://every.to/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Every</a>: A great site focused on AI related stories. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://dynomight.substack.com/p/travel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Obvious travel advice</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite being only 0.3% of the world’s population, Australians seem to make up 10% of overseas visitors everywhere on the planet.

It asks for your preferences, clarifies what you need, and produces a well-structured prompt that you can then feed into any DR model.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>Two high-value excerpts from <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/johnauthers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John Authers</a> Bloomberg newsletters: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here follows a crowd-sourced literary tip. I asked yesterday for recommendations on great detective franchises for easy reading in stressful times, and you delivered. I’ve had so many suggestions that this will need to come in installments. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To start, the name you’ve recommended most often, and with greatest enthusiasm, is <strong>Michael Connelly</strong> and his Harry Bosch series (the detective loves jazz and lives in the LA hills). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Other entrants includes the Dave Robicheaux series by <strong>James Lee Burke</strong> (set in Louisiana and starting with The Neon Rain), <strong>Arnaldur Indridason’s</strong> “really good, bleak Icelandic stuff” (try Jar City first). <strong>Volker Kutscher’s</strong> Babylon Berlin series, set in Weimar Germany. <strong>Robert van Gulik’s</strong> Judge Dee stories (written some decades ago and set in Ancient China — try Willow Pattern).  Also the Martin Beck books set in 1960-70s Sweden and written over 10 years by <strong>Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo</strong> — a husband and wife team, and godparents of Scandinavian noir (Roseanna is recommended) and the Harry Hole books by <strong>Jo Nesbo</strong>, set in Norway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be clear, I didn’t mention <strong>Raymond Chandler’s</strong> Marlowe books because I’ve already read all of them. If you’ve never dipped into Chandler, you have a treat in store — perhaps start with The Big Sleep. And as more than one of you said Connelly was as good as Chandler, I definitely want to read one of his. I’ll have plenty more suggestions tomorrow. Please, if you have any more to recommend, let me know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Herewith another installment in our crowd-sourced tour of great detective fiction franchises. You might want to try: <strong>Abir Mukherjee’s</strong> Wyndham and Banerjee series is set in India under the British Raj; the Canadian writer <strong>Eric Wright’s</strong> John Salter series, set in Toronto; <strong>Philip Kerr’s</strong> Bernie Gunther series, set in Nazi Germany; the Whitstable Pearl mysteries by <strong>Julie Wassmer</strong> (who used to be a scriptwriter for Eastenders so there are plenty of cliffhangers); <strong>Andrea Camilleri’s</strong> Inspector Montalbano series, featuring Sicily and plenty of great food; and Death of a Red Heroine, the first of the Inspector Chen series by <strong>Qiu Xiaolong</strong> in contemporary Shanghai. This comes highly recommended by Andy Rothman of Sinology, long one of my favorite guides to all things China, and by remarkable coincidence I had picked up a copy of this book from a neighborhood bookshelf earlier this week. So that’s what I’ll read next. More detectives next week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/04/10/the-domain-experts-are-drivers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drew Breunig</a> via <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/10/drew-breunig/#atom-everything\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simon Willison</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first generation of AI-powered products (often called “AI Wrapper” apps, because they “just” are wrapped around an LLM API) were quickly brought to market by small teams of engineers, picking off the low-hanging problems. But today, I’m seeing teams of domain experts wading into the field, hiring a programmer or two to handle the implementation, while the experts themselves provide the prompts, data labeling, and evaluations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For these companies, the coding is commodified but the domain expertise is the differentiator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.s-anand.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">S Anand</a>: A great website from a college senior.

Jeffrey was scheduled for open-heart surgery and transferred to the nearest children’s hospital.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In those days, surgery for PDA was invasive. Holes were cut on either side of Jeffrey’s tiny neck and chest to insert a catheter into his jugular vein. His little body was opened from breastbone to backbone, his flesh lifted aside, ribs pried apart, and a blood vessel near his heart tied off, and then all the tissues were stitched back together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Baby Jeffrey felt everything – every incision, every internal repair, every stitch. The medical team had not given their fragile patient any drugs, any comfort, anything to protect him from the excruciating pain of open-heart surgery – just a paralyzing agent to keep him still during the procedure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Five weeks later, Jeffrey passed away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the days before her child’s death, Jill Lawson learned a shocking fact: Anesthetizing babies for surgery was not common practice. After Jeffrey died, Lawson called his doctor for reassurance. Surely, she thought, her child had been given something for the pain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The anesthesiologist informed me that she had not used any anesthesia or analgesia on Jeffrey,” Lawson wrote in an account of her son’s experience. The doctor told the grieving mother it hadn’t even occurred to her to do so because it had never been demonstrated that babies can feel pain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://x.com/peeleraja/status/1901697212012507203\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@peelraja</a> via <a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/03/thursday-assorted-links-494.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MR</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The paradox of India:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Punjab is over 60% vegetarian, but Tandoori chicken and butter chicken are its most popular dishes outside the state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tamil Nadu is less than 1% vegetarian, but its &quot;pure veg&quot; idly, dosa, sambhar, pongal, etc are its most popular dishes outside the state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.norbauer.co/pages/the-seneca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Seneca</a> via <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/the-seneca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daring Fireball</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Seneca is my middle finger to the aesthetic homogeneity and economic over-optimization of 21st century life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> A keyboard for the low, low price of $3,600.

Here I use a net “happiness” measure, which is percentage Yes less percentage No with Maybe treated as zero. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Average happiness is around +20 on this scale for all respondents from 1972 to the last pre-pandemic survey (2018). However, there is a wide gap of around 30 points between married and unmarried respondents. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This “marital premium” is this paper’s subject. I describe how this premium varies across and within population groups. These include standard socio demographics (age, sex, race education, income) and more. I find little variety and thereby surface a notable regularity in US socio demography: there is a substantial marital premium for every group and subgroup I analyze, and this premium is usually close to the overall 30-point average. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This holds not just for standard characteristics but also for those directly related to marriage like children and sex (and sex preference). I also find a “cohabitation premium”, but it is much smaller (10 points) than the marital premium. The analysis is mainly visual, and there is inevitably some interesting variety across seventeen figures, such as a 5-point increase in recent years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>",

This job is hazardous. To be clear cause of death is not known and I do not want to speculate. </p>\n<p>What struck me was this bit in the report: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a 2012 interview with Complex magazine, she recalled a scene in the 2006 film “Beautiful Ohio,” starring William Hurt and Rita Wilson, that featured her “naked tush.” It was, she said, “probably one of the most horrendous moments of my life.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It would take an army — or Martin Scorsese — to ever get me naked again,” she added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a viewer, I almost never think about the person behind the character. Sure if a Christian Bale loses nearly 30kg for a role, its visible enough and stark enough that one is forced to think about the how of it. But for the most part, I watch the program and move on. Maybe if there is something really interesting or shocking, a comment to my SO. </p>\n<p>So it is a jarring to see that the impact of a brief scene stuck with the actor for years after the fact. </p>\n<p>These days there is enough nudity on screen that most of us are desensitized to seeing it and I hope the actors are too, to performing them. Even in 2006 or 2012, when maybe it was less common, I would not have imagined an actor, and especially an American<sup><a id=\"footnote-ref-1\" href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/posts/2025/links-01-mar-2025.html#footnote-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup> actor, would be so traumatized by such a scene. </p>\n<p>Maybe it is because she grew up in a time when that was a much bigger deal that it was harder on her. Perhaps actors like her were the trailblazers and paid a price and it is easier for actors now. </p>\n<p>It is, however, possible to imagine a possibility where being naked on screen is traumatizing, no matter how common and acceptable. According to Claude, the &quot;being naked in public&quot; dream genre is common across cultures and age groups and more common in adoloscents.  </p>\n<p>If that is the case I shudder to imagine the cost of all the content on Netflix and other services in a few years time. </p>\n<p>The report also has a bit on another scene she was not happy about. And guess what? At the time (and thankfully no longer), the report carried a photo from that scene.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" data-footnotes>\n<h2 id=\"footnote-label\" class=\"sr-only\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"footnote-1\">\n<p>Though, it turns out, America has a complex relationship with nudity and sexuality.
