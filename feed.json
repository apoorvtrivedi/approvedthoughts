Used sensibly this is a powerful tool. Sensibly being the key word. </p>\n<p> For me, the ability to ask unlimited questions and provide unlimited context was a huge unlock relative to visiting a Physio. Also the time saved going to and from the clinic meant I could be much more regular. </p>\n<p> I fully agree that sharing detailed context and inviting clarifying questions are very important.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In general, A.I. chatbots are far better at offering answers than asking questions, so they tend to skip the important follow-ups a physician would ask, Dr. Turken said — like whether you have any underlying conditions or are taking any medications. This is especially problematic when you’re asking about potential diagnoses or medical advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To compensate, Dr. Turken recommended prompting the chatbot with a line like: “Ask me any additional questions you need to reason safely.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://tommccarthy.net/when-quantum.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When Will Quantum Computing Work?</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Huge investments are flowing into QC companies today. IonQ has a $19B market cap, Rigetti has a $10B cap, and PsiQuantum recently raised $1B.3D-Wave is not relevant, despite high qubit counts. Their machines are annealers, rather than gate based, and have less computational power than the QCs that IonQ, Rigetti, PsiQuantum, etc. are working on. This is a lot of money for an industry generating no real revenue, and without an apparent path to revenue over the next 5 years. Qubit counts have not been doubling each year, but even if they did, we&#39;d have 32 kq machines in 2030.4If qubits double each year, 1,000 qubits today grows to 32 kq in 5 years&#39; time. There are few - if any - commercial applications for machines of that size. Will these companies keep raising larger rounds until they achieve 100 kq? Or have they got some secret sauce we don&#39;t know about that investors are betting on? </p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://blog.dshr.org/2025/10/depreciation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Depreciation</a>: A skeptical take. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He assumes that the ASICs are obsolete when they can no longer keep up with the hash rate so are no longer mining any Bitcoin. That is wrong. ASICs are obsolete when the Bitcoin they mine no longer pay for the electricity they use. The newer ASICs aren&#39;t just faster, they also use much less energy per hash. Look again at the depreciation graph, which suggests current ASICs go obsolete after 16 quarters. But Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll&#39;s estimate of 5 quarters to obsolescence is based on comparing the ASIC&#39;s production with the cost of their power consumption, which is the correct approach. The curves in the graph are correct out to the 40% line, but then should drop to zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/opinion/palantir-shyam-sankar-military.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Palantir Sees</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Douthat: So we’re going to talk about a lot of things.

But, hats off (heheh!) to the man for having the courage to participate in a story like this. Making the world a hair safer for the rest of us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Donovan’s journey to a hair system started two decades ago when, as a 20-year-old, he noticed his hair was receding. He remembers one moment when he was warming up for a game against FC Dallas in Frisco and fans started chanting at him: “Rogaine! Rogaine!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://josephheath.substack.com/p/populism-fast-and-slow?publication_id=1796678&r=2smju\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Populism fast and slow</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Working through the consequences of this, it is not difficult to see why the left has been unable to get much traction out of these changes, especially in developed countries. People are not rebelling against economic elites, but rather against cognitive elites. Narrowly construed, it is a rebellion against executive function. More generally, it is a rebellion against modern society, which requires the ceaseless exercise of cognitive inhibition and control, in order to evade exploitation, marginalization, addiction, and stigma. Elites have basically rigged all of society so that, increasingly, one must deploy the cognitive skills possessed by elites to successfully navigate the social world. (Try opening a bank account, renting an apartment, or obtaining a tax refund, without engaging in analytical processing.) The left, to the extent that it favours progress, is essentially committed to intensifying the features of the modern world that impose the greatest burdens of self-inhibition on individuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing things in this way makes it easier to understand why people get so worked up over seemingly minor issues, like language policing. The problem with demanding political correctness in speech, and punishing or ostracizing those who fail, is that it turns every conversation into a Stroop test, allowing elites the opportunity to exhibit conspicuous self-control. It requires the typical person, while speaking, to actively suppress the familiar word that is primed (e.g. “homeless”), and to substitute through explicit cognition the recently-minted word that is now favoured (e.g. “unhoused”). Elites are not just insensitive, but positively dismissive of the burdens that this imposes on many people. As a result, by performing the cognitive operation with such fluidity, they are not only demonstrating their superiority, they are rubbing other people’s faces in it. (From this perspective, it is not surprising that the demand for “they/them” pronouns upset some people even more, because the introduction of a plural pronoun forces a verb change, which requires an even more demanding cognitive performance.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://x.com/basedlayer/status/1979473779131625856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Age Inversion</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everyone under 30 is prematurely old (worried about savings, career, FIRE).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone over 50 is desperately young (Burning Man, psychedelics).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My theory: Information abundance aged the young by showing them all future problems all at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information abundance also made the old young by showing them all missed experiences all at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now Gen Z talks like retirement planners and boomers act like teenagers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#39;s so over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"tweet-container\" style=\"margin:0 auto 1rem;\">\n  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"350\">\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/basedlayer/status/1979473779131625856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><p><a href=\"\">The Remains of the Day</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/remains_of_the_day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">movie</a>: </p>\n<p> I recently read <em>The Remains of the Day</em> by Kazuo Ishiguro, after coming across a positive review and remembering that there was an Oscar nominated movie based on the book in the &#39;90s, when watching the Oscars used to be in thing in India.</p>\n<p> After the first couple of chapters, thinking that this was perhaps an artsy book, I also opened up a chat with ChatGPT to improve my understanding of the book. </p>\n<p> This was useful but note to self: in future explicitly tell ChatGPT to avoid spoilers or otherwise reveal information or conclusions from the later chapters. To be fair, I did ask for themes to notice in rest of the book so its mostly on me. </p>\n<p> This isn&#39;t a thriller so in one sense the damage was limited. It is, however, a very subtle book that gradually unveils its layers and getting a bunch of bullet points upfront, spelling out every complexity and nuance wasn&#39;t ideal. </p>\n<p> The book is a masterpiece. Very few books have ever had this effect on me where, for days afterwards, I suddenly get a flash of feeling, a pang that forces me to stop for a breath. </p>\n<p> The closest analogy that came spontaneously to my mind was of eating great Japanese food (yes, even as a vegetarian) - the flavours are extremely subdued - very much the opposite of, say, Indian food. But they are unmistakable, sharp even, if you stop and notice, and you know it took a lot of effort and craftsmanship to pull it off just right.</p>\n<p> When reading fiction, I have a tendency to really flip pages towards the end, a tendency developed from years of reading mostly thriller novels. Because of this I found the book depressing, having barely spent any thought on the final pages. It is only while writing this post that I revisited the ending (and the title) and had to reconsider my understanding.   </p>\n<p> I had identified so deeply with the sense of loss in the middle of the book that I completely missed the gentle ray of hope that Ishiguro leaves us with at the end: as humans, on any given day and at any given time, all we can do is to make the best of whatever remains of the day. </p>\n<p> Highly recommended.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

All I could think of were the uncounted men across untold generations who had lived and died as warriors, with all the honor and pain that entailed.

I moved to California in 2017, and the past 8 years seemed to pass by very quickly. I feel like time is moving twice as fast as when I was 35. Even as a 16-year old high school student I had already noticed that those “long summer vacations” seemed to pass by at twice the speed as when I was only 8 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mathematical terms, subjective time seems roughly proportional to the inverse of one’s age. (At least since age 3 or 4, before that I recall nothing.) At age N, each lived year represents 1/nth of our life.

Like half the kids were TERRIFIED of public speaking and were only doing it because their tiger moms insisted they had to (and the other half LOVED the attention). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a lot of trouble getting the scared kids to open up and one day I asked one of the youngest ones what made her so afraid of speaking in front of the class, especially since they were all her friends. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she told me she was afraid she’d say something dumb or make a mistake and everyone would make fun of her. And that they’d laugh and laugh at her if she froze up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day I asked the class if anyone was scared of being made fun of and all the shy kids raised their hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I don’t actually know if this is the same pathology in adults with fear of public speaking but I suspect it’s similar, and now I’ll get to how I addressed it which worked fabulously. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First I told them that this was a ridiculous fear and that no one would make fun of them. But of course that doesn’t do anything lol. But then I told everyone to rip out 10 pieces of paper from their notebooks and crumple them up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I told them I was going to give a speech. I told them if I said “uhh” or “um” or used any filler words they were to throw a paper ball at me and shout “shame!” 3 times pointing at me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I gave a terrible speech. And they loved it! It was so much fun for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then! I had the students give speeches with the same rules, starting with the confident ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the third student the shy ones were volunteering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the lesson I explained to them that we had accomplished 2 things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>We had demonstrated how absurd such a reaction really is, because none of them would have ever reacted in that way if they weren’t specifically asked to, and none of them had any actual malice even when they did shout “shame” at their classmates</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Everyone had experienced the comically worst case scenario imaginable of public speaking and survived!</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>So they became the rule during EVERY class and I was told by the other teachers that my shy students had started leading presentations and speaking up in class and some of them asked me how I worked with them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were HORRIFIED when I told them lol. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it worked!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> This reminds me of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Boggart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Boggarts in the Harry Potter books</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://substack.com/inbox/post/171207709\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Church Planting: When Venture Capital Finds Jesus</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guy is founding an evangelical church, and I find his ecosystem fascinating.

Yet I remained curious about why my swing was what it was. I had decent power, but lacked the ability to square the ball up with anything approaching consistency. Was I destined to always have this problem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I turned to LLMs, feeding the TrackMan stats into GPT. Based on 12 numbers, from one swing, GPT had me clocked. It knew my strengths and weaknesses. It fully understood the specifics of my poor technique. I’m sure Rob could have walked me through as much, but his time is limited. The machine had all the bandwidth in the world to deal with my “over the top” swing, how to fix it, and any other questions I might nag it with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A day later, my swing was different and self recorded video sent to Google’s Gemini confirmed the change. Swing errors that were decades in the making were corrected in the span of minutes. I’m not saying that I’ve suddenly made a leap from “Struggles to break 100” to “scratch golfer.” I’m just saying that a process that could have been expensive and arduous was instead efficient and relatively cheap. I apply the LLM’s fix, and it tells me whether I’ve actually applied it. The feedback is instant and objective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> LLMs will be like Ozempic for a lot more than golf.

GPT-5’s inability to recognize that it was incapable of playing Minesweeper may indicate that its reasoning abilities do not generalize well. Its decision to spend 5 solid hours beating its head against the unimportant side goal of sharing a spreadsheet suggests a lack of training on the importance of setting priorities. The repeated factual errors in Gemini 2.5 Pro’s writeup of its merch store experience (click the link and look for “Editor’s Notes”) suggest an inability to keep track of key information over an extended project. Claude losing track of the fact that it is not a person is a reminder that in some ways these models really are just shallow imitations of human behavior (even as they demonstrate deep capability in other areas).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> So many benefits and so many limitations. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/reading-with-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reading with AI</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reading a non-fiction book from cover-to-cover is not efficient. I used to say that I read books “from the outside in.” I look at the book flap to find out about the author, who wrote the blurbs, and the subject matter of the book. Then I read the introduction and conclusion in order to get the main ideas. If I have read something by a different author that seems relevant, I look for that author in the index, and I head to those pages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once again, I believe in “Stop, Look, and Listen.” I start by asking the AI to summarize the key themes of the book. For each theme that the AI lists, I stop and try to put it into my own words. I test my understanding by feeding my words into the AI, in order get confirmation that my interpretation is correct. Another way that I ensure understanding is to suggest possible examples or ask the AI to provide examples.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/09/how-to-think-about-ai-progress.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to think about AI progress</a>: Reproducing the entire post as it really is worth reading: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Zvi has <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/reports-of-ai-not-progressing-or\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a good survey post</a> on what is going on with the actual evidence.  I have a more general point to make, which I am drawing from my background in Austrian capital theory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are easy projects, and there are hard projects.  You might also say short-term vs. long-term investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easier, shorter-term projects get done first.  For instance, the best LLMs now have near-perfect answers for a wide range of queries.  Those answers will not be getting much better, though they may be integrated into different services in higher productivity ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those improvements will yield an ongoing stream of benefits, but you will not see much incremental progress in the underlying models themselves.  Ten years from now, the word “strawberry” still will have three r’s, and the LLMs still will tell us that.  There are other questions, such as “what is the meaning of life?” where the AI answers also will not get much better.  I do not mean that statement as AI pessimism, rather the answers can only get so good because the question is not ideally specified in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are the very difficult concrete problems, such as in the biosciences or with math olympiad problems, and so on.  Progress in these areas seems quite steady and I would call it impressive.  But it will take quite a few years before that progress is turned into improvements in daily life.  Again, that does not have to be AI pessimism.  Just look at how we run our clinical trials, or how long the FDA approval process takes for new drugs, or how many people are reluctant to accept beneficial vaccines.  I predict that AI will not speed up those processes nearly as much as it ideally might.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the AI world before us is rather rapidly being bifurcated into two sectors:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) progress already is extreme, and is hard to improve upon, and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) progress is ongoing, but will take a long time to be visible to actual users and consumers</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so people will complain that AI progress is failing us, but mostly they will be wrong.  They will be the victim of cognitive error and biases.  The reality is that progress is continuing apace, but it swallows up and renders ordinary some of its more visible successes.  What is left behind for future progress can be pretty slow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet another periodic reminder that <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MR</a> and <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Zvi</a> are both must-read for everyone.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

Everyone antes one chip and gets one card, face down. You look at your card. There’s a single round of betting, which proceeds around the table: If no one else has bet, you can bet or check (do nothing); if anyone in front of you has bet, you can call (or match the bet), raise or fold. When everyone has called the last bet or folded, those who are left in the hand show their card. The highest card wins: Ace is highest, then king, so on down to two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it. No pairs, no flushes, no full houses, no complicated order of hands to remember, though you do have to remember that a queen beats a jack. But you learn a lot of poker. You will always win with an ace, but you have to learn to maximize the value of your ace, to induce other people to bet into you and call your raises. One of my proudest moments as a parent was when my daughter first check-raised me with an ace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll probably win with a king, but if someone raises you, does that mean that they have an ace (and have you beat), or a queen (and are overconfident), or a six (and are bluffing)? There are 52 cards, so you can estimate the probabilities if you are mathematically inclined, though if you are four you probably won’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably won’t win with a six, but if you bet it confidently you might bluff everyone else out. If everyone else checks, and you’re the last person to bet, you might as well bet: You have “position,” everyone else has a weak hand, and you might be able to steal a pot. The essentials are there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the kids have mastered this, you can introduce the order of hands gently with two-card poker. (Any pair beats a high card, highest pair wins.) Then teach the rest with five-card straight poker. This isn’t a great game, but it’s a brief stopover on the way to five-card draw, which is a perfectly respectable poker game. Texas hold’em is not far behind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-my-fathers-instant-mashed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My Father&#39;s Instant Mashed Potatoes</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The chuño-chomping Incans were not the last military to rely on dehydrated potatoes for sustenance.

The easiest way to get a uniform potato commodity into the hands of G.I.s was to pulverize the potatoes into granules, dehydrate them, and then plan on bringing them back to life with boiling water in an imitation of “mashed potatoes”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> Deeper than I would have imagined from the title.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A lot more than you wanted to read on <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/childhood-and-education-13-college\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">College</a> and <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/childhood-and-education-college-admissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">College Admissions</a>.

In the last few days, those warnings have been joined by others, who have noted that there is now a video that looks and sounds like me, adding to the sales pitch with promises of super-normal returns if they reach out, and presumably send their money in. (Please don&#39;t go looking for these scams online, since the very act of clicking on them can expose you to their reach.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> It was a matter of time. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/gpt-5-it-just-does-stuff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-5: It Just Does Stuff</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GPT-5 just does stuff, often extraordinary stuff, sometimes weird stuff, sometimes very AI stuff, on its own. And that is what makes it so interesting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> To be clear this wasn&#39;t my experience. I gave it a PDF and asked it to estimate something based on the data in the file. It made up all the numbers and suggested they were in tables and pages that didn&#39;t exist in the PDF. I was not able to get it focused on the actual information in the PDF despite multiple reminders and other attempts. Apparently though, there was a bug in their system yesterday that made it appear dumber. I will try again.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

Roughly 100,000 of those rules would be deemed worthy of trimming, the PowerPoint estimates — mostly through the automated tool with some staff feedback. The PowerPoint also suggests the AI tool will save the United States trillions of dollars by reducing compliance requirements, slashing the federal budget and unlocking unspecified “external investment.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> A worthy goal for DOGE and possibly the right use of AI.

I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (&quot;Huh? I thought&quot;). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling &quot;It&#39;s... always been like this!!!!&quot; &quot;What the fuck??!&quot; followed by &quot;This is too much!! Too much!!!&quot;. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what &quot;painfully beautiful&quot; means for the first time in my life. I had to look away. I calmed a bit. I walked a few steps and looked back. The exact same thing happened. &quot;It&#39;s reproducible, hihihihi&quot;, and I started laughing. Then I found a log to sit on, calm down, and look back at the ocean. Now it wasn&#39;t overwhelming, but &quot;kinda nice&quot; was now &quot;fucking amazing&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> To do list. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/1681634/2020/03/18/this-man-is-a-pickup-basketball-god/?source=user_shared_article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yes, Adam Sandler really is a pickup basketball god (NYT Paywall)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jackson was struck by the man’s attire: extra-baggy shorts and an extra-baggy yellow T-shirt. “I’m trying to figure out: Does he buy clothes?

Like all things, this trend began in the late 60s and early 70s as mandatory reporter laws expanded and caused massive growth in child maltreatment reports. Since the 90s, the number of reports has stayed pretty stable and the number of substantiated investigations and interventions has been falling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CPS could probably scale back it’s interventions for cases of maltreatment that only involve neglect, especially those that only involve lack of supervision rather than physical neglect. Other tradeoffs between false positive and false negative investigations and interventions are more difficult to have a strong opinion on given the terrible outcomes on both sides of the trolley track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are probably some available pareto improving moves.

Thirty of the world’s most renowned mathematicians traveled to Berkeley, Calif., with some coming from as far away as the U.K. The group’s members faced off in a showdown with a “reasoning” chatbot that was tasked with solving problems they had devised to test its mathematical mettle. After throwing professor-level questions at the bot for two days, the researchers were stunned to discover it was capable of answering some of the world’s hardest solvable problems. “I have colleagues who literally said these models are approaching mathematical genius,” says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia and a leader and judge at the meeting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/world/europe/hajj-horses-spain-mecca.html?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hajj on Horseback (NYT)</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More than 1.5 million people traveled to Saudi Arabia this year for the hajj.

How many other problems is this true for? </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1925144465120870524\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&quot;One of main goals in life has been to make my parents proud&quot;</a>. 92% in Iraq, 78% in India. I remember realizing sometime in my early 30s that my parents didn&#39;t know the hierarchy of success in my field. As far as they were concerned I was already successful after college and any &quot;actual&quot; success wouldn&#39;t register with them. I felt the void in my movtivation for quite some time. Having your own kids helps with the transition. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://x.com/Econ_4_Everyone/status/1925172995481362619\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI &amp; Critical Thinking</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An interviewer just asked me what skills AI will make more important. My response? Critical thinking skills. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because in the past there was value in creating large quantities of information. That is now costless. The new currency is how to generate, assimilate, interpret, and make that large amount of information actionable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question then becomes how do we teach, and improve our own, critical thinking skills? I discuss that in a <a href=\"https://t.co/8V26lIjLxa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent study</a> where I create a critical thinking skills hierarchy.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/the-agentic-web-and-original-sin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Agentic Web and Original Sin</a>: I have been wondering about this problem for a while - who puts up the content for the LLMs to train on if everyone gets their answers from the chatbots and doesn&#39;t visit websites anymore. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem, as both I and Patel noted, is that this ecosystem depends on humans seeing those webpages, not impersonal agents impervious to advertising, which destroys the economics of ad-supported content sites, which, in the long run, dries up the supply of new content for AI. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> A potential solution: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First, the protocol layer should have a mechanism for payments via digital currency, i.e. stablecoins. Second, AI providers like ChatGPT should build an auction mechanism that pays out content sources based on the frequency with which they are cited in AI answers. The result would be a new universe of creators who will be incentivized to produce high quality content that is more likely to be useful to AI, competing in a marketplace a la the open web; indeed, this would be the new open web, but one that operates at even greater scale than the current web given the fact that human attention is a scarce resource, while the number of potential agents is infinite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/europe/norway-ship-crash-backyard.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cargo Ship Crashed Into Man’s Yard After Crewman Fell Asleep, Police Say (NYT)</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-nyc-pizza-pizzeria.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 22 Best Pizza Places in New York Right Now (NYT)</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/science/astronomy-extraterrestrial-life-k218b.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New Studies Dismiss Signs of Life on Distant Planet (NYT)</a>: Dang.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.ignorance.ai/p/seo-for-ai-a-look-at-generative-engine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO for AI: A look at Generative Engine Optimization</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/05/the-best-bookstore-in-nyc-and-then-some.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best bookstore in NYC, and then some</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.approvedthoughts.com/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/style/ditch-weekly-montauk-newspaper-hamptons.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">They’re 15.

Using Uber data, I develop an empirical model of spatial equilibrium composed of demand, supply, and matching. I find that surge pricing raises total welfare, benefitting riders but hurting drivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welfare effects differ substantially across sides of the market: rider surplus increases by 3.57% of gross revenue, whereas driver surplus and the platform’s current profits decrease by 0.98% and 0.50% of gross revenue, respectively. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense. If it hurts the platform or the drivers, why would they do it? </p>\n<p>After dropping the pearl of wisdom above, I decided to actually read <a href=\"https://t.co/DQTiI1ytXI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the paper</a>. In the first two pages I found this: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uber’s current profits decrease by 0.50% of gross revenue. This probably does not mean that Uber is hurt, but rather that it is willing to forgo current profits to increase rider surplus—the right choice if it believes that long-run shareholder value is more closely tied to rider surplus and customer retention than to current profits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Makes sense. After this my eyes glazed over and I dropped the paper in Claude and asked it why drivers would participate in this. Here&#39;s what it says: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> The paper acknowledges this is the more problematic finding. &quot;My findings suggest that drivers might have good reason to complain. Their hourly earnings are not much higher than the minimum wage, so even the small effects I find might be a concern.&quot; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, drivers may not have full information about the counterfactual (uniform pricing), and many drivers are part-time workers using Uber for supplemental income rather than as their primary employment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>",
