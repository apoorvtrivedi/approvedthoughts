some indians find official advice hard to swallow. so, when a recent government advisory put samosas along with other deep-fried indian snacks and western foods such as burgers and french fries on a list of things that should be eaten in moderation because of their high oil and sugar content, there was an unsurprising outcry. social media erupted with memes, and indian media chimed in to say the country s most iconic bites were under attack. rivatez that animals seemingly anticipate events should humble us more. changes in groundwater chemistry, electromagnetic fields and sound waves make animals restless, distressed and even relocate in the west it is seen as woo to contemplate that energy weather humans don t consciously experience can affect our psychology, and yet we forget that we are animals too. even outside extreme weather events, the lunar cycle moves oceans, huge bodies of water. we are, like all animals, primarily made of water. the word lunacy comes from the ancient understanding that our minds can be affected by it an interesting experiment is to log your daily mood for a few months- ups and downs, anxiety joy levels, big arguments with loved ones etc. then afterwards, retroactively chart it against lunar cycles and nasa space weather data that tracks geomagnetic storms, solar flares etc. be open- minded and try it. i, too, used to think this stuff was bs now i think much of modern psychiatry is giving people drugs to tune down people s individual responses to these external inputs, eg bipolar might just indicate high sensitivity how many important scientific breakthroughs lie on the other side of our collective dismissal of woo ?

and i realized why william donloe resonated, mcquarrie said. there was a perceived injustice, whether anybody could put their finger on it or not. the rise of the japanese toilet nyt in 1982, a peculiar commercial aired on televisions across japan. an actress in a pink floral dress and an updo drops paint on her hand and futilely attempts to wipe it off with toilet paper. she looks into the camera and asks everyone, if your hands get dirty, you wash them, right? it s the same for your bottom, she continues. bottoms deserve to be washed, too. civilization on the march. zarna garg went from stay-at-home mom to stand-up comedian nyt after 16 years focusing on her husband, shalabh, and her three children zoya, brij and veer ms. garg re-entered the work force in 2019, but not to return to her erstwhile career as a personal injury lawyer. instead, encouraged by her children, she started working the new york open-mic circuit and performing at westside comedy club before headlining at caroline s on broadway by 2020. in 2023, she talked her way into opening for tina fey and amy poehler on their restless leg tour, and prime video aired her special one in a billion. this spring, she made her film debut in the critically acclaimed rom-com a nice indian boy. her second special, practical people win, will air on hulu in july, and she is developing a sitcom called zarna with mindy kaling and kevin hart. the lightcone podcast on prompting video podcast i am hungry for more such reources. chattel childhood trigger warning - fairly explicit start and parts. i don t approve of the simbari childrearing, not because i think the pain and disgust of what the children are forced to do is inherently bad, but because they are forced. to love someone skillfully is to pour fuel on their soul. it s to see the world through their desire, to delight in it, and go i desire you to get what you want. it is the amplification of their will. the simbari people are destroying the will of their children. my parents destroyed my will. and i think, quite seriously, that our current culture is likewise destroying the will of its children en masse. that s what you do to property. worth thinking about although largely i don 39 t agree with this. her will seems to be doing just fine. i think humans are are social animals and whether something traumatizes us or not is often but not always a function of the social context surrounding the event. what happens to the simbari children if it in fact, does happen. i have not verified or heard of this before doesn 39 t traumatize them because everyone around them considers it perfectly normal. in my mental model, the trauma happens, when you feel something shameful or otherwise different has happened to you and everyone looks at you different. artichokes for the photos. high cost of building in us zuckerburg 39 s worth is 226 billion. the ny subway builds tunnels at 4 bil. per mile. sf 39 s bart builds subways at 2 bil. per mile. it 39 s crazy that all of zuckerberg 39 s wealth would build just 8 of the current nyc subway network. meanwhile in paris cost 250 mil. per mile. ufo?

quot one of main goals in life has been to make my parents proud quot . 92 in iraq, 78 in india. i remember realizing sometime in my early 30s that my parents didn 39 t know the hierarchy of success in my field. as far as they were concerned i was already successful after college and any quot actual quot success wouldn 39 t register with them. i felt the void in my movtivation for quite some time. having your own kids helps with the transition. ai amp critical thinking an interviewer just asked me what skills ai will make more important. my response? critical thinking skills. this is because in the past there was value in creating large quantities of information. that is now costless. the new currency is how to generate, assimilate, interpret, and make that large amount of information actionable. the next question then becomes how do we teach, and improve our own, critical thinking skills? i discuss that in a recent study where i create a critical thinking skills hierarchy. the agentic web and original sin i have been wondering about this problem for a while - who puts up the content for the llms to train on if everyone gets their answers from the chatbots and doesn 39 t visit websites anymore. the problem, as both i and patel noted, is that this ecosystem depends on humans seeing those webpages, not impersonal agents impervious to advertising, which destroys the economics of ad-supported content sites, which, in the long run, dries up the supply of new content for ai. a potential solution first, the protocol layer should have a mechanism for payments via digital currency, i.e. stablecoins. second, ai providers like chatgpt should build an auction mechanism that pays out content sources based on the frequency with which they are cited in ai answers. the result would be a new universe of creators who will be incentivized to produce high quality content that is more likely to be useful to ai, competing in a marketplace a la the open web indeed, this would be the new open web, but one that operates at even greater scale than the current web given the fact that human attention is a scarce resource, while the number of potential agents is infinite. cargo ship crashed into man s yard after crewman fell asleep, police say nyt the 22 best pizza places in new york right now nyt new studies dismiss signs of life on distant planet nyt dang. seo for ai a look at generative engine optimization the best bookstore in nyc, and then some they re 15. wait until you read their newspaper. nyt we still haven t done hot dogs, teddy said. billy agreed hot dogs should be an editorial priority. and we were still very young we had no idea what we were doing, said billy, a junior varsity quarterback whose hair was tousled into a cruciferous mop. know hope! use of digital technologies was associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment or 0.42, 95 ci 0.35 0.52 and reduced time-dependent rates of cognitive decline hr 0.74, 95 ci 0.66 0.84 . effects remained significant when accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, health and cognitive reserve proxies. paper here. putting claude 4 opus in an open playground to chat with itself led to it diving into philosophical explorations of consciousness, self-awareness, and by 30 turns it eventually started using sanskrit can 39 t wait till nationalist politicians from my home state get their hands on this. sanskrit! toronto burger shop called good fortune burger renamed its menu items to sound like office supplies, helping remote workers potentially expense meals through work accounts. the quot basic steel stapler quot and quot braided hdmi cord are popular. as a reply points out this doesn 39 t make sense because the order is still from a place called good fortune burger. who benefits from surge pricing? what are the welfare effects of surge pricing? using uber data, i develop an empirical model of spatial equilibrium composed of demand, supply, and matching. i find that surge pricing raises total welfare, benefitting riders but hurting drivers. welfare effects differ substantially across sides of the market rider surplus increases by 3.57 of gross revenue, whereas driver surplus and the platform s current profits decrease by 0.98 and 0.50 of gross revenue, respectively. this doesn 39 t make sense. if it hurts the platform or the drivers, why would they do it? after dropping the pearl of wisdom above, i decided to actually read the paper . in the first two pages i found this uber s current profits decrease by 0.50 of gross revenue. this probably does not mean that uber is hurt, but rather that it is willing to forgo current profits to increase rider surplus the right choice if it believes that long-run shareholder value is more closely tied to rider surplus and customer retention than to current profits. makes sense. after this my eyes glazed over and i dropped the paper in claude and asked it why drivers would participate in this. here 39 s what it says the paper acknowledges this is the more problematic finding. quot my findings suggest that drivers might have good reason to complain. their hourly earnings are not much higher than the minimum wage, so even the small effects i find might be a concern. quot however, drivers may not have full information about the counterfactual uniform pricing , and many drivers are part-time workers using uber for supplemental income rather than as their primary employment.",

this is how i started on claude 3.5 sonnet i have recently purchased a domain for a website. i used cloudflare for purchasing the domain. i would now like to set up a wordpress or other website at the domain. walk me through the steps of doing this. the sonnet is the most intelligent model by anthropic. it is the go to model at the moment for a lot of the people i follow and the only model i pay for. the project went through multiple chats because after a while, in each chat, i would start getting this message here, for the first time, i used a trick i had recently seen i think on twitter. ok - i have saved and deployed on cloudflare. however i am getting the message that this chat has become too long. can you provide a status update that i can use with another ai chatbot to continue this work? and it did! i pasted the update in another chat and the conversation continued there as if it was the same chat! you can check out the first chat here . i think hope it has no confidential information. i won t be sharing the remaining chats because they do have some of my account credentials. this one should provide enough context for most of what i am discussing here though. so how d it go? well you ve seen the website , so clearly not as well as i d hoped. that said, i am continuing with the project and based on what i have learned so far, i am hopeful i will eventually get it working. it is still remarkable that i got this far, considering that i have zero experience with the technologies services involved. claude successfully walked me through setting up 3 different services cloudflare, github and hugo and had them work with each other to serve up the site. all of this happened within a couple of hours and with me blindly following its instructions - copying and pasting code where it asked me to, choosing the options it asked me to and only making high level decisions, like which theme i liked for the blog, which require no technical sophistication. for the most part, all of this was one-shot , meaning it told me to do something, in plain english, i did the thing and it all worked. where it required a second shot, it was because i hadn t provided the full context e.g. that i was using a mac and not a pc. and once i clarified that, it adjusted the directions for all subsequent steps. in fact, because i use claude almost exclusively, i had forgotten how much better it is that some of the other models at being almost human . this chat is not very different from how i would interact with it support engineer at work. just randomly dropping bits of context or asides and having it be incorporated correctly into subsequent interactions as relevant. in one of the subsequent chats, it seemed to me like claude was stuck or going around in circles, without fixing the problem, so i decided to switch to the newly launched deepseek-r1 reasoning model. while the r1 made immediate progress where claude was stuck, the experience of working with the r1 was just so much harder. unlike claude, which understood that i was not technically sophisticated, and only gave tasks of a manageable size at each stage, the r1 would just throw a laundry list of complex tasks at me. for e.g. there s a set of 3 commands i needed to run on the terminal app on my mac, after every change to the code. this would push the changes to github. every time there would be only minor changes to these commands. claude would provide these commands every time, unprompted. r1 would not. claude also seemed to just understand better where we were in the overall project at all times. so if it asked me to do three things and if i went back with a question about the first thing, it would help me fix that and then go back to the remaining two items in the list. r1 did not seem to have as good an understanding of the overall project and did not seem to appreciate that if i was asking a question about step 2 of 5, that steps 3-5 still needed to be done after it answered the question about step 2. of course, the answer to step 2 would have 5 steps, so now i have to scroll back and forth to figure out which step of which step i am on. so despite being a stronger model, i found it discouraging and just much harder with the r1 to have to keep track of where we were in the project. what went wrong? i suspect the website would be looking a lot better if i had just followed claude s guidance. in fact, even now, i think it is at a stage where i can post these weekly updates there with some extra effort. but i knew i was going to be traveling for a few weeks and so after the site was ready for me to start posting content, i asked claude if we could also set up a cms, content management system, for the website. that way i could post from anywhere instead of just from my desktop and include links and images in the posts with minimal effort. things went off the rails pretty much immediately. without getting into a lot of detail, we encountered a bug while setting up the authorization setup for the cms. claude kept suggesting various tweaks but nothing worked. it felt to me like we were going around in circles, trying the same things over and over again. i even asked claude to look at the entire conversation and figure out if it was going around in circles. it gave itself a clean chit. of the 6 or so hours i have spend on this project, my guess is 4-5 have been trying to resolve this issue. my suspicion is that claude is trained on an older version of the various services projects i am using and therefore could not fix these errors. eventually i gave up with claude and took the project over to deepseek r1. it made some progress, identifying some errors claude had made, e.g. key files located in wrong folders, wrong parameters etc. however since neither of the models can really take over and look at the code themselves, they may not be able to fix issues caused by my mistakes in implementing their directions. maybe ai agents will fix this issue in future. in any event, the project is on pause as i travel and i am wondering whether i should start from scratch with deepseek instead of trying to fix the current version. what did i learn? a lot. despite the hiccup, i feel comfortable that these models can help me do projects that i just couldn t have done before. i intend to try more projects, and of course, finish this one. different models have very different skills and it s important to figure out which model is the best for a given task. while claude is the easiest to talk to, almost like a person, it really helps to understand how to prompt other models to get the best out of them. providing more context and better instructions can result in much better results. larger context windows will change everything. a model that can keep your entire life in context will be multiple orders of magnitude more helpful than the current models. i am a little more skeptical than before about llms becoming generally intelligent or superintelligent. their ability to deal with problems that are not in their training data seems limited. maybe agentic models will overcome some of this but breakthroughs in for e.g. fundamental physics seem unlikely. obviously i am extrapolating from a tiny sample but that s the direction in which i have updated my priors. what s next? i have a few ideas i want to work on once not if! i finish the website. i wonder if i can set up a web server on my old mac and run a few basic services off it. for e.g. creating a url shortening service like bitly or a qr code generation service. this from simon willison is my inspiration. 14 projects in 1 week. no rocket science but just small, useful things here and there. or, if i am more ambitious, that custom spaced repetition app built by andy matuschak, i mentioned couple of weeks ago. is truly customized software possible? i hope it is.",

    "searchableText": "what is spaced repetition sr ? claude says spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at gradually increasing intervals. here 39 s how it works when you first learn something new, you review it fairly soon like the next day . if you remember it well, you wait a bit longer before the next review maybe 3 days . if you still remember it well, you extend the interval further perhaps a week, then two weeks, then a month . the key principles behind spaced repetition are the spacing effect information is better remembered when studying is spread out over time rather than crammed into a single session. the testing effect actively recalling information strengthens memory more effectively than passive review. this may not sound revolutionary. after all, some version of this is how we prepared for our exams. but the important thing is that unlike the 90s, there s an app for that anki , mochi amp others . the app handles the spacing and repetition, making it more practical, reliable and scalable. when i first learned about and used sr apps years ago, i thought, wow! it would have been great to have this in school. this will be great for the boys in a few years. i never used the technique until last year when i used anki for homeschooling the kids in hindi. you can get many ready-made decks free amp paid on the anki website, but creating your own necessary for specific requirements was a chore, and i stopped after a few months. i thought sr was for students until i saw a dwarkesh patel podcast with dan shipper using it to learn more broadly. it wasn t limited to coursework or vocabulary but included concepts. he claims it allows for better understanding of linkages and patterns over time. but what had my jaw drop was that he used claude chatgpt to create the cards! of course. just throw in the material you are learning into claude, ask it to create sr cards for the material and you re done. it may need some editing or creating additional cards, but it s generally good enough. it can even output in anki file format. rope in an ai and the amount of knowledge you can include in your sr system just explodes. while researching this piece, i revisited alexey guzey s original post that introduced me to the concept. i didn t remember this, but the first thing he talks about is to use sr for instilling novel thought patterns. front card saying no back card if i want to say no, i will stop and make sure this is not just status quo bias coz it probably is status quo bias sucks. does this one solve it? beautifully so. although several months had passed before it finally kicked in, the number of times i noticed saying no out of status quo bias, then having this thought come up and make me retroactively reverse the initial no is in the tens already. will this work? i am not sure, but between how dwarkesh is using sr and this, i feel the case for having my own sr system is growing stronger. hopefully, i ll have an update in a few weeks. how do you train? tyler cowen s post inspired by david perell planted another bug in my brain. athletes train. musicians train. performers train. but knowledge workers don t. recently, one of my favorite questions to bug people with has been what is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales? if you don t know the answer to that one, maybe you are doing something wrong or not doing enough. or maybe you are optimally? not very ambitious? here s his answer . of course, i didn t know the answer to that one. watching andy matuschak study quantum mechanics with dwarkesh patel who else? led to a few realisations. having the right tools and workflows and being good at them is a huge productivity unlock. in the video, andy uses custom software that allows him to do much more, faster. he reads, creates sr cards, and reviews material on the fly. he also knows how to put mathematical symbols in his notes, making useful cards so much more quickly. what is the difference in learning between someone manually revising from a textbook before an exam as i used to do and someone using a custom sr system, ai-generated sr cards, and a workflow to push those cards daily? huge. this year, i plan to practice getting better with the keyboard. how long can i work on my desktop without touching the mouse? to switch between windows and apps, and use functions within apps? sure, i can do ctrl c and ctrl v. but can i effortlessly do alt e s v f paste special gt formulas in excel ? can i do 50 other menu actions across multiple programs? can i set up workflows for routine processes and use ai to automate? the second thing that struck me was the depth of his learning approach. sure, it s a tough topic, but he spent 20 min on the first page, asking questions, drawing connections, testing himself, and revising. i don t recall engaging with my coursework so diligently. the last thing that occurred to me is how important and hard it is to learn these hacks tricks workflows. some people just know and others never do. here s a great resource for this tacit knowledge. i m glad someone recognised the importance of the concept, named it, and created a knowledge base.",
