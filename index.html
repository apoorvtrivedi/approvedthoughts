<li><p>And the amazing thing is that <a href="https://x.com/ZyMazza/status/1965054215157346739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the opposite works</a> too!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I mentioned this before but I was a national speech and debate octafinalist in high school and I was able to parlay that into a job running a debate program at an ambitious charter middle school in college. </p>



<p>My approach was the exact opposite of this. Like half the kids were TERRIFIED of public speaking and were only doing it because their tiger moms insisted they had to (and the other half LOVED the attention). </p>



<p>I had a lot of trouble getting the scared kids to open up and one day I asked one of the youngest ones what made her so afraid of speaking in front of the class, especially since they were all her friends. </p>



<p>And she told me she was afraid she‚Äôd say something dumb or make a mistake and everyone would make fun of her. And that they‚Äôd laugh and laugh at her if she froze up. </p>



<p>The next day I asked the class if anyone was scared of being made fun of and all the shy kids raised their hands. </p>



<p>Now I don‚Äôt actually know if this is the same pathology in adults with fear of public speaking but I suspect it‚Äôs similar, and now I‚Äôll get to how I addressed it which worked fabulously. </p>



<p>First I told them that this was a ridiculous fear and that no one would make fun of them. But of course that doesn‚Äôt do anything lol. But then I told everyone to rip out 10 pieces of paper from their notebooks and crumple them up. </p>



<p>And I told them I was going to give a speech. I told them if I said ‚Äúuhh‚Äù or ‚Äúum‚Äù or used any filler words they were to throw a paper ball at me and shout ‚Äúshame!‚Äù 3 times pointing at me. </p>



<p>And I gave a terrible speech. And they loved it! It was so much fun for them. </p>



<p>But then! I had the students give speeches with the same rules, starting with the confident ones. </p>



<p>After the third student the shy ones were volunteering. </p>



<p>After the lesson I explained to them that we had accomplished 2 things:</p>



<ol>
<li>We had demonstrated how absurd such a reaction really is, because none of them would have ever reacted in that way if they weren‚Äôt specifically asked to, and none of them had any actual malice even when they did shout ‚Äúshame‚Äù at their classmates</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li>Everyone had experienced the comically worst case scenario imaginable of public speaking and survived!</li>
</ol>



<p>So they became the rule during EVERY class and I was told by the other teachers that my shy students had started leading presentations and speaking up in class and some of them asked me how I worked with them. </p>



<p>They were HORRIFIED when I told them lol. </p>



<p>But it worked!</p>

<p>This guy is founding an evangelical church, and I find his ecosystem fascinating. First for its stunning similarities to venture-capital-funded tech start-ups, and then for its simplicity and open-heartedness. None of the dynamics in church planting are unique or even particularly rare, but they are unobfuscated, and that makes church planting the equivalent of a large print book for the social dynamics that favor charismatic narcissists.</p>

<p>We received the problems in the exact same PDF form, and the reasoning system selected which answers to submit with no bespoke test-time harness whatsoever. For 11 of the 12 problems, the system‚Äôs first answer was correct. For the hardest problem, it succeeded on the 9th submission. Notably, the best human team achieved 11/12.</p>



<p>We competed with an ensemble of general-purpose reasoning models; we did not train any model specifically for the ICPC. We had both GPT-5 and an experimental reasoning model generating solutions, and the experimental reasoning model selecting which solutions to submit. GPT-5 answered 11 correctly, and the last (and most difficult problem) was solved by the experimental reasoning model.</p>

Something to sleep in at night and a bathing suit if you‚Äôre headed somewhere warm. I always bring an extra pair of underwear and socks because sometimes I like to change throughout the day. Then experiment by trying on a bunch items to ensure everything goes together. Frankly, it‚Äôs not that different than figuring out what you‚Äôre going to wear on a day-to-day basis, which I trust you do all the time.</p>

<p>Rob was fantastic but it‚Äôs not as though I can just do a TrackMan excursion all the time. Yet I remained curious about why my swing was what it was. I had decent power, but lacked the ability to square the ball up with anything approaching consistency. Was I destined to always have this problem?</p>



<p>And so I turned to LLMs, feeding the TrackMan stats into GPT. Based on 12 numbers, from one swing, GPT had me clocked. It knew my strengths and weaknesses. It fully understood the specifics of my poor technique. I‚Äôm sure Rob could have walked me through as much, but his time is limited. The machine had all the bandwidth in the world to deal with my ‚Äúover the top‚Äù swing, how to fix it, and any other questions I might nag it with.</p>



<p>A day later, my swing was different and self recorded video sent to Google‚Äôs Gemini confirmed the change. Swing errors that were decades in the making were corrected in the span of minutes. I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôve suddenly made a leap from ‚ÄúStruggles to break 100‚Äù to ‚Äúscratch golfer.‚Äù I‚Äôm just saying that a process that could have been expensive and arduous was instead efficient and relatively cheap. I apply the LLM‚Äôs fix, and it tells me whether I‚Äôve actually applied it. The feedback is instant and objective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to say exactly why, even with all this progress, current AI models are still so hopeless at dealing with open-ended real-world situations. GPT-5‚Äôs inability to recognize that it was incapable of playing Minesweeper may indicate that its reasoning abilities do not generalize well. Its decision to spend 5 solid hours beating its head against the unimportant side goal of sharing a spreadsheet suggests a lack of training on the importance of setting priorities. The repeated factual errors in Gemini 2.5 Pro‚Äôs writeup of its merch store experience (click the link and look for ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Notes‚Äù) suggest an inability to keep track of key information over an extended project. Claude losing track of the fact that it is not a person is a reminder that in some ways these models really are just shallow imitations of human behavior (even as they demonstrate deep capability in other areas).</p>

<p>Reading a non-fiction book from cover-to-cover is not efficient.

Then I read the introduction and conclusion in order to get the main ideas. If I have read something by a different author that seems relevant, I look for that author in the index, and I head to those pages.</p>

<p> and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once again, I believe in ‚ÄúStop, Look, and Listen.‚Äù I start by asking the AI to summarize the key themes of the book. For each theme that the AI lists, I stop and try to put it into my own words. I test my understanding by feeding my words into the AI, in order get confirmation that my interpretation is correct. Another way that I ensure understanding is to suggest possible examples or ask the AI to provide examples.</p>

<p>There are easy projects, and there are hard projects.  You might also say short-term vs. long-term investments.</p>



<p>The easier, shorter-term projects get done first.  For instance, the best LLMs now have near-perfect answers for a wide range of queries.  Those answers will not be getting much better, though they may be integrated into different services in higher productivity ways.</p>



<p>Those improvements will yield an ongoing stream of benefits, but you will not see much incremental progress in the underlying models themselves.  Ten years from now, the word ‚Äústrawberry‚Äù still will have three r‚Äôs, and the LLMs still will tell us that.  There are other questions, such as ‚Äúwhat is the meaning of life?‚Äù where the AI answers also will not get much better.  I do not mean that statement as AI pessimism, rather the answers can only get so good because the question is not ideally specified in the first place.</p>



<p>Then there are the very difficult concrete problems, such as in the biosciences or with math olympiad problems, and so on.  Progress in these areas seems quite steady and I would call it impressive.  But it will take quite a few years before that progress is turned into improvements in daily life.  Again, that does not have to be AI pessimism.  Just look at how we run our clinical trials, or how long the FDA approval process takes for new drugs, or how many people are reluctant to accept beneficial vaccines.  I predict that AI will not speed up those processes nearly as much as it ideally might.</p>



<p>So the AI world before us is rather rapidly being bifurcated into two sectors:</p>



<p>a) progress already is extreme, and is hard to improve upon, and</p>



<p>b) progress is ongoing, but will take a long time to be visible to actual users and consumers</p>



<p>And so people will complain that AI progress is failing us, but mostly they will be wrong.  They will be the victim of cognitive error and biases.  The reality is that progress is continuing apace, but it swallows up and renders ordinary some of its more visible successes.  What is left behind for future progress can be pretty slow.</p>

<p>I meet a lot of people who don‚Äôt like their jobs, and when I ask them what they‚Äôd rather do instead, about 75% say something like, ‚ÄúOh, I dunno, I‚Äôd really love to run a little coffee shop.‚Äù If I‚Äôm feeling mischievous that day, I ask them one question: ‚ÄúWhere would you get the coffee beans?‚Äù</p>



<p>If that‚Äôs a stumper, here are some followups: Which kind of coffee mug is best? How much does a La Marzocco espresso machine cost? Would you bake your blueberry muffins in-house or would you buy them from a third party?</p>



<p>The point of the Coffee Beans Procedure is this: if you can‚Äôt answer those questions, if you don‚Äôt even find them <em>interesting</em>, then you should not open a coffee shop, because this is how you will spend your days as a cafe owner. You will not be sitting droopy-lidded in an easy chair, sipping a latte and greeting your regulars as you page through <em>Anna Karenina</em>.

<blockquote>
<p>Solutions from experts follow a familiar pattern, claiming that the only way to avert a crisis is to adopt radical social and behavioral changes, driven by moral proselytizing, government intervention, or both, to save the water supply. Environmentalists urge people to replace old toilets with low-flow models, avoid running faucets while brushing their teeth or washing dishes, and switch to eating less water-intensive foods. Meanwhile, activists pressure elected officials to impose usage restrictions, ban certain crops in arid regions, and regulate everything from swimming pools to car washes.</p>



<p>Fortunately the economics of water innovation reveals why the apparent scarcity tends to be self-correcting, without requiring us to adopt ascetic lifestyles or perform symbolic actions like picking up dropped ice cubes to water house plants or writing letters to elected officials. Rising prices, not moralizing pleas, lead people to conserve, look for substitutes, recycle resources, and innovate helping to meet demand through alternative means or improved efficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right way to begin is with one-card poker. Everyone antes one chip and gets one card, face down. You look at your card. There‚Äôs a single round of betting, which proceeds around the table: If no one else has bet, you can bet or check (do nothing); if anyone in front of you has bet, you can call (or match the bet), raise or fold. When everyone has called the last bet or folded, those who are left in the hand show their card. The highest card wins: Ace is highest, then king, so on down to two.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs it. No pairs, no flushes, no full houses, no complicated order of hands to remember, though you do have to remember that a queen beats a jack. But you learn a lot of poker. You will always win with an ace, but you have to learn to maximize the value of your ace, to induce other people to bet into you and call your raises. One of my proudest moments as a parent was when my daughter first check-raised me with an ace.</p>



<p>You‚Äôll probably win with a king, but if someone raises you, does that mean that they have an ace (and have you beat), or a queen (and are overconfident), or a six (and are bluffing)? There are 52 cards, so you can estimate the probabilities if you are mathematically inclined, though if you are four you probably won‚Äôt.</p>



<p>You probably won‚Äôt win with a six, but if you bet it confidently you might bluff everyone else out. If everyone else checks, and you‚Äôre the last person to bet, you might as well bet: You have ‚Äúposition,‚Äù everyone else has a weak hand, and you might be able to steal a pot. The essentials are there.</p>



<p>Once the kids have mastered this, you can introduce the order of hands gently with two-card poker. (Any pair beats a high card, highest pair wins.) Then teach the rest with five-card straight poker. This isn‚Äôt a great game, but it‚Äôs a brief stopover on the way to five-card draw, which is a perfectly respectable poker game. Texas hold‚Äôem is not far behind.</p>

<p>The chu√±o-chomping Incans were not the last military to rely on dehydrated potatoes for sustenance. In World War II, the US Army experimented with various forms of potato dehydration to help stretch supply lines. The easiest way to get a uniform potato commodity into the hands of G.I.s was to pulverize the potatoes into granules, dehydrate them, and then plan on bringing them back to life with boiling water in an imitation of ‚Äúmashed potatoes‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started receiving a stream of message about an Instagram post that I was allegedly starring in, where after offering my views on Palantir&#39;s valuation, I was soliciting investors to invest with me (or with an investment entity that had ties to me). I was not surprised, since I have lived with imitations for years, but I was bemused, since I don&#39;t have an Instagram account and have not posted on Facebook more than once or twice in a decade. In the last few days, those warnings have been joined by others, who have noted that there is now a video that looks and sounds like me, adding to the sales pitch with promises of super-normal returns if they reach out, and presumably send their money in. (Please don&#39;t go looking for these scams online, since the very act of clicking on them can expose you to their reach.)</p>

<p> To be clear this wasn&#39;t my experience. I gave it a PDF and asked it to estimate something based on the data in the file. It made up all the numbers and suggested they were in tables and pages that didn&#39;t exist in the PDF. I was not able to get it focused on the actual information in the PDF despite multiple reminders and other attempts. Apparently though, there was a bug in their system yesterday that made it appear dumber. I will try again.</p>

<p>The tool, called the ‚ÄúDOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool,‚Äù is supposed to analyze roughly 200,000 federal regulations to determine which can be eliminated because they are no longer required by law, according to a PowerPoint presentation obtained by The Post that is dated July 1 and outlines DOGE‚Äôs plans. Roughly 100,000 of those rules would be deemed worthy of trimming, the PowerPoint estimates ‚Äî mostly through the automated tool with some staff feedback. The PowerPoint also suggests the AI tool will save the United States trillions of dollars by reducing compliance requirements, slashing the federal budget and unlocking unspecified ‚Äúexternal investment.‚Äù</p>

It is hard to imagine that a much better plan could have been approved given who was doing the approving.</p>

<p>So I went down to the beach. &quot;Kinda nice&quot;, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had &#39;the right size&#39;, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (&quot;Huh? I thought&quot;). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling &quot;It&#39;s... always been like this!!!!&quot; &quot;What the fuck??!&quot; followed by &quot;This is too much!! Too much!!!&quot;. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what &quot;painfully beautiful&quot; means for the first time in my life. I had to look away. I calmed a bit. I walked a few steps and looked back. The exact same thing happened. &quot;It&#39;s reproducible, hihihihi&quot;, and I started laughing. Then I found a log to sit on, calm down, and look back at the ocean. Now it wasn&#39;t overwhelming, but &quot;kinda nice&quot; was now &quot;fucking amazing&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Art can outlast the artist ‚Äî but what about their artistic impulses?</p>



<p>A new art installation project in Australia, titled &quot;Revivification,&quot; raises this question with a very literal interpretation of &quot;impulse&quot;: using his DNA, the team behind the project have performed a quasi-resurrection of the late experimental American composer Alvin Lucier, creating a sort of brain that continuously composes music on the fly with its errant electrical signals.</p>



<p>At the center of the piece is an &quot;in-vitro brain,&quot; grown from blood that Lucier, who passed away in 2021, donated in the final years of his life. Housed in a plinth, it&#39;s grown on top of an electrode mesh that connects it to twenty large brass plates placed around the room. Visitors can listen as the brain fires off electrical pulses that trigger a transducer and a mallet behind each plate, striking them to produce sound.</p>
