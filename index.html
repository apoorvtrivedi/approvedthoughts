<p>I meet a lot of people who don’t like their jobs, and when I ask them what they’d rather do instead, about 75% say something like, “Oh, I dunno, I’d really love to run a little coffee shop.” If I’m feeling mischievous that day, I ask them one question: “Where would you get the coffee beans?”</p>

<p>If that’s a stumper, here are some followups:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which kind of coffee mug is best?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How much does a La Marzocco espresso machine cost?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you bake your blueberry muffins in-house or would you buy them from a third party?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The point of the Coffee Beans Procedure is this: if you can’t answer those questions, if you don’t even find them <em>interesting</em>, then you should not open a coffee shop, because this is how you will spend your days as a cafe owner. You will not be sitting droopy-lidded in an easy chair, sipping a latte and greeting your regulars as you page through <em>Anna Karenina</em>. You will be running a small business that sells hot bean water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Solutions from experts follow a familiar pattern, claiming that the only way to avert a crisis is to adopt radical social and behavioral changes, driven by moral proselytizing, government intervention, or both, to save the water supply. Environmentalists urge people to replace old toilets with low-flow models, avoid running faucets while brushing their teeth or washing dishes, and switch to eating less water-intensive foods. Meanwhile, activists pressure elected officials to impose usage restrictions, ban certain crops in arid regions, and regulate everything from swimming pools to car washes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately the economics of water innovation reveals why the apparent scarcity tends to be self-correcting, without requiring us to adopt ascetic lifestyles or perform symbolic actions like picking up dropped ice cubes to water house plants or writing letters to elected officials. Rising prices, not moralizing pleas, lead people to conserve, look for substitutes, recycle resources, and innovate helping to meet demand through alternative means or improved efficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right way to begin is with one-card poker. Everyone antes one chip and gets one card, face down. You look at your card. There’s a single round of betting, which proceeds around the table: If no one else has bet, you can bet or check (do nothing); if anyone in front of you has bet, you can call (or match the bet), raise or fold. When everyone has called the last bet or folded, those who are left in the hand show their card. The highest card wins: Ace is highest, then king, so on down to two.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s it. No pairs, no flushes, no full houses, no complicated order of hands to remember, though you do have to remember that a queen beats a jack. But you learn a lot of poker. You will always win with an ace, but you have to learn to maximize the value of your ace, to induce other people to bet into you and call your raises. One of my proudest moments as a parent was when my daughter first check-raised me with an ace.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ll probably win with a king, but if someone raises you, does that mean that they have an ace (and have you beat), or a queen (and are overconfident), or a six (and are bluffing)? There are 52 cards, so you can estimate the probabilities if you are mathematically inclined, though if you are four you probably won’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You probably won’t win with a six, but if you bet it confidently you might bluff everyone else out. If everyone else checks, and you’re the last person to bet, you might as well bet: You have “position,” everyone else has a weak hand, and you might be able to steal a pot. The essentials are there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the kids have mastered this, you can introduce the order of hands gently with two-card poker. (Any pair beats a high card, highest pair wins.) Then teach the rest with five-card straight poker. This isn’t a great game, but it’s a brief stopover on the way to five-card draw, which is a perfectly respectable poker game. Texas hold’em is not far behind.</p>

<p>The chuño-chomping Incans were not the last military to rely on dehydrated potatoes for sustenance. In World War II, the US Army experimented with various forms of potato dehydration to help stretch supply lines. The easiest way to get a uniform potato commodity into the hands of G.I.s was to pulverize the potatoes into granules, dehydrate them, and then plan on bringing them back to life with boiling water in an imitation of “mashed potatoes”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started receiving a stream of message about an Instagram post that I was allegedly starring in, where after offering my views on Palantir&#39;s valuation, I was soliciting investors to invest with me (or with an investment entity that had ties to me). I was not surprised, since I have lived with imitations for years, but I was bemused, since I don&#39;t have an Instagram account and have not posted on Facebook more than once or twice in a decade. In the last few days, those warnings have been joined by others, who have noted that there is now a video that looks and sounds like me, adding to the sales pitch with promises of super-normal returns if they reach out, and presumably send their money in. (Please don&#39;t go looking for these scams online, since the very act of clicking on them can expose you to their reach.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p> To be clear this wasn&#39;t my experience. I gave it a PDF and asked it to estimate something based on the data in the file. It made up all the numbers and suggested they were in tables and pages that didn&#39;t exist in the PDF. I was not able to get it focused on the actual information in the PDF despite multiple reminders and other attempts. Apparently though, there was a bug in their system yesterday that made it appear dumber. I will try again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tool, called the “DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool,” is supposed to analyze roughly 200,000 federal regulations to determine which can be eliminated because they are no longer required by law, according to a PowerPoint presentation obtained by The Post that is dated July 1 and outlines DOGE’s plans. Roughly 100,000 of those rules would be deemed worthy of trimming, the PowerPoint estimates — mostly through the automated tool with some staff feedback. The PowerPoint also suggests the AI tool will save the United States trillions of dollars by reducing compliance requirements, slashing the federal budget and unlocking unspecified “external investment.”</p>

<p>Otherwise, while this is far from a perfect plan or the plan I would choose, on the substance it is a good plan, a positive plan, with many unexpectedly good plans within it. There is a lot of attention to detail in ways those I’ve asked say reflect people who actually know what they are doing, which was by no means something to be taken for granted. It is hard to imagine that a much better plan could have been approved given who was doing the approving.</p>

<p>So I went down to the beach. &quot;Kinda nice&quot;, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had &#39;the right size&#39;, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (&quot;Huh? I thought&quot;). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling &quot;It&#39;s... always been like this!!!!&quot; &quot;What the fuck??!&quot; followed by &quot;This is too much!! Too much!!!&quot;. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what &quot;painfully beautiful&quot; means for the first time in my life. I had to look away. I calmed a bit. I walked a few steps and looked back. The exact same thing happened. &quot;It&#39;s reproducible, hihihihi&quot;, and I started laughing. Then I found a log to sit on, calm down, and look back at the ocean. Now it wasn&#39;t overwhelming, but &quot;kinda nice&quot; was now &quot;fucking amazing&quot;.</p>

<p>Jackson was struck by the man’s attire: extra-baggy shorts and an extra-baggy yellow T-shirt. “I’m trying to figure out: Does he buy clothes? Did he buy them and then just stop buying them? His clothes really might have been from 2008.” It soon became apparent, however, that the guy could play. He was a true court general. He impressed Jackson with his basketball IQ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Art can outlast the artist — but what about their artistic impulses?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A new art installation project in Australia, titled &quot;Revivification,&quot; raises this question with a very literal interpretation of &quot;impulse&quot;: using his DNA, the team behind the project have performed a quasi-resurrection of the late experimental American composer Alvin Lucier, creating a sort of brain that continuously composes music on the fly with its errant electrical signals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the center of the piece is an &quot;in-vitro brain,&quot; grown from blood that Lucier, who passed away in 2021, donated in the final years of his life. Housed in a plinth, it&#39;s grown on top of an electrode mesh that connects it to twenty large brass plates placed around the room. Visitors can listen as the brain fires off electrical pulses that trigger a transducer and a mallet behind each plate, striking them to produce sound.</p>

<p>Teachout’s idea that suppliers “make up the difference” by charging smaller stores more is also economically incoherent. Profit-maximizing firms already charge what the market will bear. If Costco’s volume justifies a discount, that doesn’t mean suppliers can or should charge higher prices to other buyers. Yes, there are models where costs change with volume but costs could go down with volume and, in any case, those models don’t rely on the folk theory of “making up the difference.”</p>

In contrast, the response to what I called the “DeepSeek” moment has been nearly the opposite. Why did Sputnik spark investment while DeepSeek sparks retrenchment?

<p>The scale of CPS investigations in the US is staggering. Like all things, this trend began in the late 60s and early 70s as mandatory reporter laws expanded and caused massive growth in child maltreatment reports. Since the 90s, the number of reports has stayed pretty stable and the number of substantiated investigations and interventions has been falling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The CPS could probably scale back it’s interventions for cases of maltreatment that only involve neglect, especially those that only involve lack of supervision rather than physical neglect. Other tradeoffs between false positive and false negative investigations and interventions are more difficult to have a strong opinion on given the terrible outcomes on both sides of the trolley track.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are probably some available pareto improving moves. The most straightforward in my view would be increasing staffing and state capacity in family courts so that cases can be reviewed more accurately and without requiring months or years of effort and tens of thousands of dollars on the part of the parents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a weekend in mid-May, a clandestine mathematical conclave convened. Thirty of the world’s most renowned mathematicians traveled to Berkeley, Calif., with some coming from as far away as the U.K. The group’s members faced off in a showdown with a “reasoning” chatbot that was tasked with solving problems they had devised to test its mathematical mettle. After throwing professor-level questions at the bot for two days, the researchers were stunned to discover it was capable of answering some of the world’s hardest solvable problems. “I have colleagues who literally said these models are approaching mathematical genius,” says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia and a leader and judge at the meeting.</p>

The challenge is that these systems are getting really complex to understand. I am going to try and help a bit with both.</p>

And for years, nothing worked. But after undergoing ibogaine treatment at a clinic in Mexico, Marcus came back changed. He no longer needed opioids. He hasn’t touched alcohol in years. He even quit chewing Copenhagen, a longtime habit.</p>

<p> Worth thinking about although largely I don&#39;t agree with this. Her will seems to be doing just fine. </p>
<p> I think humans are are social animals and whether something traumatizes us or not is often (but not always) a function of the social context surrounding the event. What happens to the Simbari children (if it in fact, does happen. I have not verified or heard of this before) doesn&#39;t traumatize them because everyone around them considers it perfectly normal. </p>
<p> In my mental model, the trauma happens, when you feel something shameful or otherwise different has happened to you and everyone looks at you different. </p>

<p>The next question then becomes how do we teach, and improve our own, critical thinking skills? I discuss that in a <a href="https://t.co/8V26lIjLxa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> where I create a critical thinking skills hierarchy.  </p>

<li><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/the-agentic-web-and-original-sin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Agentic Web and Original Sin</a>: I have been wondering about this problem for a while - who puts up the content for the LLMs to train on if everyone gets their answers from the chatbots and doesn&#39;t visit websites anymore. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem, as both I and Patel noted, is that this ecosystem depends on humans seeing those webpages, not impersonal agents impervious to advertising, which destroys the economics of ad-supported content sites, which, in the long run, dries up the supply of new content for AI. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> A potential solution: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the protocol layer should have a mechanism for payments via digital currency, i.e. stablecoins. Second, AI providers like ChatGPT should build an auction mechanism that pays out content sources based on the frequency with which they are cited in AI answers. The result would be a new universe of creators who will be incentivized to produce high quality content that is more likely to be useful to AI, competing in a marketplace a la the open web; indeed, this would be the new open web, but one that operates at even greater scale than the current web given the fact that human attention is a scarce resource, while the number of potential agents is infinite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the welfare effects of surge pricing? Using Uber data, I develop an empirical model of spatial equilibrium composed of demand, supply, and matching. I find that surge pricing raises total welfare, benefitting riders but hurting drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Welfare effects differ substantially across sides of the market: rider surplus increases by 3.57% of gross revenue, whereas driver surplus and the platform’s current profits decrease by 0.98% and 0.50% of gross revenue, respectively. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense. If it hurts the platform or the drivers, why would they do it? </p>
<p>After dropping the pearl of wisdom above, I decided to actually read <a href="https://t.co/DQTiI1ytXI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a>. In the first two pages I found this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uber’s current profits decrease by 0.50% of gross revenue. This probably does not mean that Uber is hurt, but rather that it is willing to forgo current profits to increase rider surplus—the right choice if it believes that long-run shareholder value is more closely tied to rider surplus and customer retention than to current profits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes sense. After this my eyes glazed over and I dropped the paper in Claude and asked it why drivers would participate in this. Here&#39;s what it says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> The paper acknowledges this is the more problematic finding. &quot;My findings suggest that drivers might have good reason to complain. Their hourly earnings are not much higher than the minimum wage, so even the small effects I find might be a concern.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, drivers may not have full information about the counterfactual (uniform pricing), and many drivers are part-time workers using Uber for supplemental income rather than as their primary employment.</p>
