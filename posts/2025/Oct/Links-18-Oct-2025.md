1. Happy Diwali to those who celebrate! NYT had two glossy stories on just one [Diwali Ball](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/style/diwali-ball-new-york-priyanka-chopra-nora-fatehi.html) in New York organized by [Priyanka Chopra's manager](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/nyregion/anjula-acharia-diwali-ball.html). Made me go "Hmmm...". Was this about Diwali, was this about Priyanka Chopra or was this something else?

2. [London Became a Global Hub for Phone Theft. Now We Know Why.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/europe/london-police-phone-theft-china-gang.html) Not a fan of clickbait headlines in NYT TBH but this story was revealing. I was under the impression that phone theft was a thing of past because of the hard to crack passcodes. Turns out not. The article didn't make it very clear how the thieves could get the phones working again. Apparently they can be sold for parts and something something China. Anyway, time to be careful out there again. 

3. The pendulum has swung away from wokeness and cancel culture, as it should have. But sometimes it feels like, instead of passing through the center it [went straight to the other end](https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-great-feminization/). 

4. [Title Arbitrage as Status Engineering](https://www.humaninvariant.com/blog/titles): 
    > Title arbitrage is one of the most scalable levers a company can pull to increase the status of certain roles and attract talent. It costs nothing, works at scale, yet has the ability to reshape labor markets. The design space for title arbitrage remains wide open.

5. There are many ways through which the LLM subscriptions pay for themselves. For me it was physiotherapy. Here it is filing tax returns. I also wish more people would share "how tos" for solving different problems with LLMs. Here's a [manual](https://fixmydocuments.com/blog/06_tax_gpt_using_ai_for_tax_prep) for tax returns. Full disclosure: I haven't tried it yet but the source is credible.

6. [Five technological achievements! (That we won’t see any time soon.)](https://crookedtimber.org/2025/09/09/five-technological-achievements-that-we-wont-see-any-time-soon/): 

7. [Observations on AI and the Capital Markets in 2025](https://vinaysridhar.com/ai-capital-markets-reflections.html)
    > "To provide some sense of scale, that means the equivalent of about $1,800 per person in America will be invested this year on AI". That is a bucketload of spending.

8. [China Can't Win](https://www.campbellramble.ai/p/china-cant-win): Retweets are not endorsments, as they say. However there is a chorus of experts out there loudly claiming that China holds the upper hand in the tariff negotiations with US. I am not so sure and this looks like a worthwhile counterpoint. Added to reading list. 
    > China cannot win the decoupling because they face an impossible trilemma: protect the currency, bail out the banks, or maintain social stability. They can pick two at most. More likely, they get one. The math is unforgiving: $5-10 trillion in hidden property losses against $3 trillion in bank equity. That’s not a solvency problem—it’s a physics problem. Meanwhile, they’re bleeding $1.1 trillion annually just to hide the losses, burning their entire defense and R&D budget combined on financial zombies.

9. Now that wokeness is over, is it ok to link to Louis CK clips again? Can one separate the art from the artist? I don't know but I love this one:
