1. [The Diaspora Paradox](https://substack.com/inbox/post/168173740) Second in a series from [Samir Varma](https://substack.com/@samirvarma)
    > But here's the paradox that has haunted me for decades: Why do so many Indians who escape India's constraints become more Indian abroad? Why does the uncle who couldn't be bothered to visit temples in Mumbai suddenly become a founding member of the Hindu temple in New Jersey? Why does the software engineer who rebelled against arranged marriage in Bangalore now insist their American-born daughter marry within the community?

2. [The First in 30 Years: Scientists Discover New Class of Antibiotics](https://scitechdaily.com/the-first-in-30-years-scientists-discover-new-class-of-antibiotics/): 
    > Led by scientist Gerry Wright, the team has discovered a powerful new molecule called lariocidin. This promising candidate shows the ability to fight some of the toughest, most drug-resistant bacteria known to science. Their groundbreaking findings were published in the journal Nature.

3. [Why We’re Surrounding Our Kids with AI](https://secondvoice.substack.com/p/why-were-surrounding-our-kids-with): 
    > We also don’t plan on perpetuating modern Western parents’ egregiously hands-off nature with regard to their kids’ dating and marriage prospects. We already have a going list of agentic, thoughtful, high-achieving families whose kids are close to our kids in age; as our kids get older, we’ll start organizing gatherings for families in this network where our kids can hang out and get to know each other (trips, summer camps, discord servers, study groups, etc.). As our kids reach their late teens and early 20s, we’ll begin organizing modern versions of the London Season—a series of events and gatherings at which our single kids ready for marriage can meet, mix, and get to know each other.

    Did not see this coming.

4. [Babies made using three people's DNA are born free of hereditary disease](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8179z199vo):
    > Eight babies have been born in the UK using genetic material from three people to prevent devastating and often fatal conditions, doctors say.

    > The method, pioneered by UK scientists, combines the egg and sperm from a mum and dad with a second egg from a donor woman.

5. [The Sputnik vs. Deep Seek Moment: The Answers](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/07/the-sputnik-vs-deep-seek-moment-the-answers.html)
    > I pointed out that the US response to Sputnik was fierce competition. Following Sputnik, we increased funding for education, especially math, science and foreign languages, organizations like ARPA were spun up, federal funding for R&D was increased, immigration rules were loosened, foreign talent was attracted and tariff barriers continued to fall. In contrast, the response to what I called the “DeepSeek” moment has been nearly the opposite. Why did Sputnik spark investment while DeepSeek sparks retrenchment? I examine four explanations from the comments and argue that the rise of zero-sum thinking best fits the data.

6. [Reflections on OpenAI](https://calv.info/openai-reflections): 
    > I left OpenAI three weeks ago. I had joined the company back in May 2024.

    > I wanted to share my reflections because there's a lot of smoke and noise around what OpenAI is doing, but not a lot of first-hand accounts of what the culture of working there actually feels like.

7. [ChatGPT Agent](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/) and [Gold-medal level performance in International Math Olympiad (IMO)](https://x.com/alexwei_/status/1946477742855532918). [More on the IMO](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/#atom-everything). 

8. [Psychological techniques to persuade AI](https://x.com/emollick/status/1946251413312471210). 

9. [Spud-tacular: How India became a french fry superpower](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced2zpvv179o): 
    > Gujarat has become India's capital of french fry production, home to huge factories churning out chips, including facilities belonging to Canadian giant McCain Foods and India's biggest maker of French Fries, HyFun Foods.
