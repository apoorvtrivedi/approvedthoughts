1. [Terrified Girls, Helicopters and a Harrowing Scene: A Rescuer’s Account at Camp Mystic (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/06/us/texas-floods-rescues.html):
    > Scott Ruskan, a Coast Guard swimmer, is credited with saving 165 people at the all-girls’ camp from deadly floods in Central Texas.

    > Mr. Ruskan realized that staying on scene would free up two extra spots on his helicopter for the evacuees, he said, so he told his unit, “I’d love to stay, I could do a lot more good on the ground.”

    > He became the main person on scene to both triage and provide emotional support to the survivors.

    Hero.

5. [For a few days this summer, your days will be just a smidge shorter (WaPo)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/07/11/shorter-days-faster-earth-rotation/)
    > During the summer, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, which minimizes the difference in temperature between the equator and Earth’s poles. This smaller temperature variation slows down the jet stream — a narrow band of strong winds around 30,000 feet above us — and moves it northward.
