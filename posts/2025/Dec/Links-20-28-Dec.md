A long one to mark a year of link posts. Starting with feel-good stories for the festive season. 

1. The [best story](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxwllqz1l0o) you’ll read this Christmas. Truly.

2. [Your Social Muscles Are Wasting Away. Here Is How to Retrain Them.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/community-housing-friendship.html?unlocked_article_code=1._E8.Q-Ij.uj6eZ0xBQBY_&smid=nytcore-ios-share): Everything old is new again and the search for connection is timeless. 
    > I’m a married 41-year-old woman who lives with housemates by choice. Rather than trying to acquire as much space and privacy as we could as quickly as we could, my husband and I decided to do the opposite. Parenting in our mid-30s, bursting out of our small London flat, we rented and then bought a London home with another couple. 

3. [Sisters in Sweat](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-23/sisters-in-sweat-football-movement-without-judgement/106099240): A couple years ago I played soccer every saturday morning, for about a year. Great memories. I get this. New year resolution. 
    > SiS has become a lifeline for thousands of women like Almeida in India, helping build a rare space where sport turns into an experience of liberation and camaraderie.
    
4. [How I read](https://buttondown.com/Booktime/archive/book-time-26-how-i-read/): I have stopped reading long form for a while, so I am a sucker for these guides. Not a New Year resolution though. 
    > One of the many joys of living in New York City is the library system. The Performing Arts Library and Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library (on Fifth Ave across from the main branch) are both delightful places to spend a few hours in Manhattan, and in Brooklyn I spent more than my fair share of afternoons at the Grand Army Plaza main branch. I pick a section and walk the shelves until I get hungry, thirsty, or under-caffeinated.

5. [I count AI summarized books as “Read”](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/i-count-ai-summarized-books-as-read/): Possibly a New Year resolution. 
    > I upload books to Claude and ask it to “Comprehensively and engagingly summarize and fact-check, writing in Malcolm Gladwell’s style, the book …”. I can read it in an hour instead of twelve. Four bullet points instead of forty. With (this surprised me) roughly the same number of insights I actually do something with.

6. [Ruby's Ultimate Guide to Thoughtful Gifts](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dmLnWjyqAi5N2pqqz/ruby-s-ultimate-guide-to-thoughtful-gifts): New Year resolution?? Who am I kidding?
    > Give a man a gift and he smiles for a day. Teach a man to gift and he’ll cause smiles for the rest of his life.

7. [The Lost Generation](https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-lost-generation/): Tough reading. 
    > At the time, I blamed those women. Of course I did. They’ve since ascended the TV ladder and work as co-executive producers on major shows. On some level, even today I can’t help but think: That could have been me. That should have been me.

    > But those women didn’t take our jobs any more than the 50-year-old Hollywood lifers had. The lifers were still there. They’re still there. And I’m not angry at the women and people of color who made it instead of me—people have the right, in most cases the responsibility, to take the opportunities that are offered them—or even at the older white guys who ensured that I didn’t. 

8. [Paranoia: A Beginner's Guide](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yXSKGm4txgbC3gvNs/paranoia-a-beginner-s-guide): Worth reading just for the first line. 
    > People sometimes make mistakes. (Citation Needed)

9. [Chemical hygiene](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/chemical-hygiene/): A good follow up to the previous link?
    
10. [How Did the C.I.A. Lose a Nuclear Device?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/13/world/asia/cia-nuclear-device-himalayas-nanda-devi.html?unlocked_article_code=1.8k8.yB_i.Rl6p6NkHRzcq&smid=nytcore-ios-share) Where else but in India?
    > A plutonium-packed generator disappeared on one of the world’s highest mountains in a hush-hush mission the U.S. still won’t talk about.

11. [Castration increases lifespan across vertebrates](https://x.com/DrDominicNg/status/1999506871997313193): Or at least, it feels longer.

12. [Pedagogy Recommendations](https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pedagogy-recommendations/): 
    > I think the single most thing important I can say is this: Every time you are inclined to use the word “teach”, replace it with “learn”. That is, instead of saying, “I teach”, say “They learn”. It’s very easy to determine what you teach; you can just fill slides with text and claim to have taught. Shift your focus to determining how you know whether they learned what you claim to have taught (or indeed anything at all!). That is much harder, but that is also the real objective of any educator.

13. [How Google Maps quietly allocates survival across London’s restaurants](https://laurenleek.substack.com/p/how-google-maps-quietly-allocates?triedRedirect=true): It's amazing the rabbit holes people will go down. 
    > I needed a restaurant recommendation, so I did what every normal person would do: I scraped every single restaurant in Greater London and built a machine-learning model.

14. I didn't think the current LLMs could solve "out-of-sample" problems, ones that are not in their training set. But I [was wrong](https://x.com/JohSch314/status/2001300666917208222). And [another one](https://x.com/spicey_lemonade/status/2004558572496035892). These are hard problems from the looks of it.

15. [Automate your life with Claude Code](https://t.co/lGGBjlfe7b):

16. [Copywriters reveal how AI has decimated their industry](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/copywriters-reveal-how-ai-has-decimated-their-industry/#atom-everything): It is coming for the white-collar jobs.
    > AI is really dehumanizing, and I am still working through issues of self-worth as a result of this experience. When you go from knowing you are valuable and valued, with all the hope in the world of a full career and the ability to provide other people with jobs... To being relegated to someone who edits AI drafts of copy at a steep discount because “most of the work is already done” ...
