1. [Humans killed millions of vultures. Now people are paying the price. (WaPo)](https://wapo.st/3Kwgm3S): So many unexpected links and unintended consequences. 
    > Although other animals scavenge dead cattle, none do so as effectively as vultures. The birds will pick clean a bull carcass in 30 to 40 minutes.

    > A paper published a year ago in the American Economic Review concluded that in certain districts, “the functional extinction of vultures — efficient scavengers who removed carcasses from the environment — increased human mortality by over 4% because of a large negative shock to sanitation.”

2. [Accommodation Nation](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/01/elite-university-student-accommodation/684946/?gift=o6MjJQpusU9ebnFuymVdsFCUJZQ0G9lMNnLXcGfnS-w): 
    > At Brown and Harvard, more than 20 percent of undergraduates are registered as disabled. At Amherst, that figure is 34 percent.

    > The types of accommodations vary widely. Some are uncontroversial, such as universities outfitting buildings with ramps and providing course materials in braille. These allow disabled students to access the same opportunities as their classmates. Some students get approved for housing accommodations, including single rooms and emotional-support animals.

    > Other accommodations risk putting the needs of one student over the experience of their peers. One administrator told me that a student at a public college in California had permission to bring their mother to class. This became a problem, because the mom turned out to be an enthusiastic class participant.

    > Professors told me that the most common—and most contentious—accommodation is the granting of extra time on exams. For students with learning disabilities, the extra time may be necessary to complete the test. But unlike a wheelchair ramp, this kind of accommodation can be exploited. Research confirms what intuition suggests: Extra time can confer an advantage to students who don’t have a disability.

3. [52 things I learned in 2025](https://medium.com/@tomwhitwell/52-things-i-learned-in-2025-edeca7e3fdd8): 
    > Global suicide rates have declined by 29% since 2000, due to measures like pesticide bans, more responsible media reporting of suicide, mental health education in schools and improved healthcare responses.

4. [Kidney Recipient Dies After Transplant From Organ Donor Who Had Rabies (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/06/health/rabies-death-skunk-kidney-transplant.html?unlocked_article_code=1.608.k035.oLxVa6Tf7ytX&smid=url-share): When its your time...
    > Since 1978, four organ donors have passed rabies to 13 organ recipients, the report said. Of the 13 recipients, six who received treatment for rabies survived. The seven others, who did not receive treatment, died.

5. [Bublé for a Day, but He Can’t Sing and There’s Little Resemblance (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/06/arts/michael-buble-impersonator-documentary.html?unlocked_article_code=1.608.EZUE.bsciBnBdyzGf&smid=nytcore-ios-share): 
    > “Any outcome is funny,” Perlman, 36, said in an interview. “If they hate me, it’s funny. If they’re confused, it’s funny. If they love me, it’s funny. And my ego is not wrapped up in the idea of being the best Michael Bublé impersonator, so there’s some freedom in that.”

    > After the performance, Perlman was astonished as people approached him for autographs and photos. He riffed about his Christmas special, his children and his love of Canada, and assured a handful of skeptics that, yes, he was the real Bublé.

6. [How Kit Kat Was Killed: Video Shows What a Robot Taxi Couldn’t See (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/us/waymo-kit-kat-san-francisco.html?unlocked_article_code=1.608.ByvU.9N8971TJWuAC&smid=url-share): Both the points below are correct but do they belong in the same paragraph? Of course, Ms. Brigman is right that Kit Kat might still be alive if there was a human driver behind the wheel of that car, but how many more cats and humans will die and be injured because the emotional response to incidents like these delays the adoption of self-driving cars? The response to this accident will [make every Waymo better](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/waymo-driverless-cars-safety-record/3858460/). The same is not true of accidents with human drivers. 

    > Those who defend Waymo taxis have pointed out that human drivers kill hundreds of animals each year in San Francisco. But Ms. Brigman believes that Kit Kat might still be alive if a human had been behind the wheel that October night.
