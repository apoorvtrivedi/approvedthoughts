1. This feels accurate.  üòÖ. He says AGI but looking at the next link I wonder if this is true for plain old AI.

2. Two weeks ago, it was Will Smith eating pizza. Now its this. Click the link to see the video. WhatsApp University is about to go nuts.

3. [She Is in Love With ChatGPT (NSFW. NYT Paywall.)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/technology/ai-chatgpt-boyfriend-companion.html?unlocked_article_code=1.qE4.UC15.fl6VLz0ieDDC&smid=url-share) And you thought K-Dramas were stealing your spouse.

4. [The Serendipity Machine](https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/the-serendipity-machine) or how to use Twitter better. A few years ago I implemented a simple algorithm on my twitter feed: 
    
    a. Block everyone who talks about politics and 
    
    b. Block everyone who is is dissing / attacking anyone / anything.

    In less than a month my feed stopped being the anxiety inducing, doomscrolling  nightmare that it was and transformed into the best source of learning & inspiration on internet. This piece takes you to the next level.

    Committing to writing this newsletter has also been great. Now instead of mindlessly flicking my finger and consuming, I have a purpose every time I open Twitter. Its almost energising to engage actively with each tweet, thoughtfully considering whether its fit to be served to my exceptionally smart and good-looking audience.

1. [E(X)>0: An Open Letter to Elon](https://open.substack.com/pub/betonit/p/ex0-an-open-letter-to-elon): 
    > ‚ÄúYour top engineers and programmers are only able to work 80-hour weeks because they can hire nannies and maids, ride in Ubers, and order food delivery. High-skill productivity depends on an abundance of complementary low-skill productivity.‚Äù

    
    As a repeat immigrant, I have many thoughts on this debate going on in US right now. There‚Äôs a lot that is wrong with a policy of focusing exclusively on so called Skill or Merit based immigration. This piece from Bryan Caplan makes some good points.

6. [The War for India](https://overcast.fm/+AAb53OdmwCk): I am enjoying this talk by Prof. Sarah Paine of the Naval War College. She talks about the history of international conflict and politics in South Asia and the role to US & Russia. I did not know that India supported China‚Äôs bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. ü§Ø üò±

7. Better ways to wear a Polo: Always a pleasure to see a master in action.

‚Äú‚Ä¶networking conferences where there‚Äôs plated cantaloupe.‚Äù *chef‚Äôs kiss*.

Here‚Äôs another one from Derek:

8. [Fix Your Glutes. (NYT Paywall)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/magazine/glutes-running.html) Strongly endorse. Really helps when trying to hold a fart but many other benefits too.

    > My frail-as-porcelain glutes ‚Äî the cluster of tissue from hip to thigh tasked with keeping the body upright and on occasion propelling it forward ‚Äî were causing a domino chain of damage, and had most likely been doing so for some time. To compensate for the glutes‚Äô infirmity, my ankles, knees, hips and even my shoulders and arms had to thrash madly, taking on vast and uneven amounts of pressure, often far more than they were structurally fit to bear

    and

    > Only after I started remedying my ‚Äúgluteal amnesia‚Äù (real medical term) did it become clear how little I knew about basic affairs like walking, standing and sitting (or living, for that matter). Within a week of the mandated twisting and shimmying and clam-shelling, my spine was noticeably straighter, smoother. Four weeks later and I could finally walk without pain again. It took three months more to fully rebalance my loopy musculature and break into a manageable jog ‚Äî but when I did, I noticed a wondrous new power to each step and spring. My reawakened haunch muscles were doing their job.Programming note: I will be on the road next few weeks. Wish me luck with getting these out on time.

    For the last two months, I have been doing a core workout formulated personally for me by (who else?) ChatGPT, with a special focus on glutes and I can feel the difference, not just in my ability, but my willingness to do things. Core strength is underrated and it isn‚Äôt just about the abs. You can have a six-pack and a weak core. I happen to have one of those.

That‚Äôs it for this week. It seems like my writing and links are all AI all the time but that isn‚Äôt the intention. However it is a space where a lot of fun stuff is happening right now and so that‚Äôs the path of least resistant.

I will be on the road for the next few weeks so programming may be light. Hopefully the website will be ready soon.
