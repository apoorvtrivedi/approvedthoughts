<blockquote>
<p>The right way to begin is with one-card poker. Everyone antes one chip and gets one card, face down. You look at your card. There‚Äôs a single round of betting, which proceeds around the table: If no one else has bet, you can bet or check (do nothing); if anyone in front of you has bet, you can call (or match the bet), raise or fold. When everyone has called the last bet or folded, those who are left in the hand show their card. The highest card wins: Ace is highest, then king, so on down to two.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That‚Äôs it. No pairs, no flushes, no full houses, no complicated order of hands to remember, though you do have to remember that a queen beats a jack. But you learn a lot of poker. You will always win with an ace, but you have to learn to maximize the value of your ace, to induce other people to bet into you and call your raises. One of my proudest moments as a parent was when my daughter first check-raised me with an ace.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You‚Äôll probably win with a king, but if someone raises you, does that mean that they have an ace (and have you beat), or a queen (and are overconfident), or a six (and are bluffing)? There are 52 cards, so you can estimate the probabilities if you are mathematically inclined, though if you are four you probably won‚Äôt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You probably won‚Äôt win with a six, but if you bet it confidently you might bluff everyone else out. If everyone else checks, and you‚Äôre the last person to bet, you might as well bet: You have ‚Äúposition,‚Äù everyone else has a weak hand, and you might be able to steal a pot. The essentials are there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the kids have mastered this, you can introduce the order of hands gently with two-card poker. (Any pair beats a high card, highest pair wins.) Then teach the rest with five-card straight poker. This isn‚Äôt a great game, but it‚Äôs a brief stopover on the way to five-card draw, which is a perfectly respectable poker game. Texas hold‚Äôem is not far behind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The chu√±o-chomping Incans were not the last military to rely on dehydrated potatoes for sustenance. In World War II, the US Army experimented with various forms of potato dehydration to help stretch supply lines. The easiest way to get a uniform potato commodity into the hands of G.I.s was to pulverize the potatoes into granules, dehydrate them, and then plan on bringing them back to life with boiling water in an imitation of ‚Äúmashed potatoes‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started receiving a stream of message about an Instagram post that I was allegedly starring in, where after offering my views on Palantir&#39;s valuation, I was soliciting investors to invest with me (or with an investment entity that had ties to me). I was not surprised, since I have lived with imitations for years, but I was bemused, since I don&#39;t have an Instagram account and have not posted on Facebook more than once or twice in a decade. In the last few days, those warnings have been joined by others, who have noted that there is now a video that looks and sounds like me, adding to the sales pitch with promises of super-normal returns if they reach out, and presumably send their money in. (Please don&#39;t go looking for these scams online, since the very act of clicking on them can expose you to their reach.)</p>

<p> It was a matter of time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>GPT-5 just does stuff, often extraordinary stuff, sometimes weird stuff, sometimes very AI stuff, on its own. And that is what makes it so interesting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> To be clear this wasn&#39;t my experience. I gave it a PDF and asked it to estimate something based on the data in the file. It made up all the numbers and suggested they were in tables and pages that didn&#39;t exist in the PDF. I was not able to get it focused on the actual information in the PDF despite multiple reminders and other attempts. Apparently though, there was a bug in their system yesterday that made it appear dumber. I will try again.</p>
