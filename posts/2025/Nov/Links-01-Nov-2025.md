2. [Pumpkin Stylists Are Making a Killing This Fall](https://www.wsj.com/style/pumpkinscapers-are-making-a-killing-this-fall-ac74baa8): 
    > Her most popular package today is her smallest, which costs $325, comes with about 20 pumpkins and takes her six minutes to assemble into a display. The second-most popular is the biggest, at $1,350; that one takes her about 30 minutes. She can do the installations in the dark, wearing a headlamp. 

3. [Japan’s sushi legend Jiro Ono turns 100 and is not ready for retirement](https://apnews.com/article/japan-sushi-jiro-centenarian-film-michelin-32dd0d4232d9818e38f8b8a984bab636): 
    > What’s the secret of his health? “To work,” Ono replied to the question by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, who congratulated him.

    > “I can no longer come to the restaurant every day ... but even at 100, I try to work if possible. I believe the best medicine is to work.”

4. [She hiked the entire Appalachian Trail at 80, unaware she’d just made history](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/10/29/appalachian-trail-hike-betty-kellenberger/): 
    > The day Betty Kellenberger hit a patch of freezing rain on Mount Madison, quitting crossed her mind. She was hungry, cold and sore.

    > “You’re 80 years old,” she told herself in a pep talk atop a mountain in New Hampshire. “You can do it.”

    > A few months later, Kellenberger stood at the Massachusetts-Vermont border, having just finished hiking the entire 2,197-mile Appalachian Trail. She became, without realizing it, the oldest woman ever to do it.
    
    > “We put all kinds of limitations on ourselves,” said Kellenberger, who lives in Carson City, Michigan. “Sometimes the biggest one is we don’t get up and try it.”

5. [I Tried the First Humanoid Home Robot. It Got Weird.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3c4mQty_so) I look forward to the day something like this becomes real and it may be "real soon now", but I think this take from [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/31/stern-1x-neo) is exactly right: 

    > The argument from CEO Bernt Børnich is that they’re using the videos from the current state of Neo, where its actions are entirely remote-controlled by employees of 1X Technologies, to train its autonomy. I call bullshit. This looks to me like nothing but a scam. It’s not autonomous at all, I don’t believe this company is going to achieve any practical degree of autonomy with this product, and even while it’s remote-controlled by human operators, it’s slow and clumsy.

6. [5 Tips When Consulting ‘Dr.’ ChatGPT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/well/chatgpt-health-questions.html?): As someone who has saved hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in Physiotherapy bill using ChatGPT and is seemingly at the verge of fixing a long-standing chronic back pain, I am a fan. Used sensibly this is a powerful tool. Sensibly being the key word. 

    For me, the ability to ask unlimited questions and provide unlimited context was a huge unlock relative to visiting a Physio. Also the time saved going to and from the clinic meant I could be much more regular. 

    I fully agree that sharing detailed context and inviting clarifying questions are very important.  
    > In general, A.I. chatbots are far better at offering answers than asking questions, so they tend to skip the important follow-ups a physician would ask, Dr. Turken said — like whether you have any underlying conditions or are taking any medications. This is especially problematic when you’re asking about potential diagnoses or medical advice.

    > To compensate, Dr. Turken recommended prompting the chatbot with a line like: “Ask me any additional questions you need to reason safely.”

7. [When Will Quantum Computing Work?](https://tommccarthy.net/when-quantum.html)
    > Huge investments are flowing into QC companies today. IonQ has a $19B market cap, Rigetti has a $10B cap, and PsiQuantum recently raised $1B.3D-Wave is not relevant, despite high qubit counts. Their machines are annealers, rather than gate based, and have less computational power than the QCs that IonQ, Rigetti, PsiQuantum, etc. are working on. This is a lot of money for an industry generating no real revenue, and without an apparent path to revenue over the next 5 years. Qubit counts have not been doubling each year, but even if they did, we'd have 32 kq machines in 2030.4If qubits double each year, 1,000 qubits today grows to 32 kq in 5 years' time. There are few - if any - commercial applications for machines of that size. Will these companies keep raising larger rounds until they achieve 100 kq? Or have they got some secret sauce we don't know about that investors are betting on? 

8. [Depreciation](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/10/depreciation.html): A skeptical take. 
    > He assumes that the ASICs are obsolete when they can no longer keep up with the hash rate so are no longer mining any Bitcoin. That is wrong. ASICs are obsolete when the Bitcoin they mine no longer pay for the electricity they use. The newer ASICs aren't just faster, they also use much less energy per hash. Look again at the depreciation graph, which suggests current ASICs go obsolete after 16 quarters. But Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll's estimate of 5 quarters to obsolescence is based on comparing the ASIC's production with the cost of their power consumption, which is the correct approach. The curves in the graph are correct out to the 40% line, but then should drop to zero.

9. [What Palantir Sees](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/opinion/palantir-shyam-sankar-military.html): 

    > Douthat: So we’re going to talk about a lot of things. We’re going to talk about your biography and background, how you came to be an officer in the U.S. military, the future of technology and warfare. But we have to start with a very, very simple question: What is it that Palantir does?

    > Sankar: Great question.

    > Douthat: Thank you.

    > Sankar: Obviously the most important question, yeah.

    > Douthat: I spent a long time crafting it, I have to say.
