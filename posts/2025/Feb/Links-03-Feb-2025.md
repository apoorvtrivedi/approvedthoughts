> Most books should have been blog posts, most blog posts should have been tweets and most tweets should never have been written. - Unknown Tweeter

Another set of AI-heavy links. I can’t help myself right now.

1. [Set up a fake cricket league](https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a63009827/fake-cricket-league/): 
    > These arrangements might have suggested that the league featured professional-grade cricket that an online audience would find worth watching, but in fact, the players weren’t established cricketers or even skilled amateurs. They were locals that Davda had recruited with the promise of paying 400 rupees (about £3.50) per day — twice what people in the area make in daily wages working on farms and for local businesses.

     Respect.

2. [How to choose a religion (NYT Paywall)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/opinion/religion-faith-choose.html): 
    > But for the general obligation imposed upon us all, as time-bound creatures in a world shot through with intimations of transcendence, a different Eliot line is apt: “For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.” 

    I didn’t know Eliot plagiarized The Gita. The book is called [Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious](https://www.zondervan.com/p/believe/). I hope to read this book.

3. [I am (not) a Failure: Lessons Learned From Six (and a half) Failed Startup Attempts.]() I am a sucker for these stories, having a failed startup in my recent past. The conclusion conveniently helps me feel good about the failure.

4. Agency:

5. How to prepare for an AI future: Coincidentally, I ran into a number of pieces on this topic last week. The first one from [Tyler Cowen](https://x.com/chrisbarber/status/1884722769327501594) and the second from [Nate Silver](https://www.natesilver.net/p/sbsq-17-how-should-you-prepare-for). Both have the same advice in the first place: use LLMs more than you do and for more things than you do.

6. [Using AI to build a nuclear fusor](https://www.corememory.com/p/a-young-man-used-ai-to-build-a-nuclear): Combining the wisdom of the previous two links.

7. [Using AI to improve learning](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/professor-tailored-ai-tutor-to-physics-course-engagement-doubled/): I would love to see how the tutor was created. Perhaps I, too, need to take the advice from links 4 & 5 and do this project myself.
