A jumbo edition this week after a two-week break that was really not necessary. 

1. [At Secret Math Meeting, Researchers Struggle to Outsmart AI](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/inside-the-secret-meeting-where-mathematicians-struggled-to-outsmart-ai/): 
    > On a weekend in mid-May, a clandestine mathematical conclave convened. Thirty of the world’s most renowned mathematicians traveled to Berkeley, Calif., with some coming from as far away as the U.K. The group’s members faced off in a showdown with a “reasoning” chatbot that was tasked with solving problems they had devised to test its mathematical mettle. After throwing professor-level questions at the bot for two days, the researchers were stunned to discover it was capable of answering some of the world’s hardest solvable problems. “I have colleagues who literally said these models are approaching mathematical genius,” says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia and a leader and judge at the meeting.

2. [Hajj on Horseback (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/world/europe/hajj-horses-spain-mecca.html?): 
    > More than 1.5 million people traveled to Saudi Arabia this year for the hajj. Only three of them rode on horseback all the way from Spain, recreating the pilgrimage of Andalusian Muslims centuries ago and sharing their travels in the most modern way with big followings on social media.

3. [Festivo, All Festivals, Everywhere (in Asia, for now)](https://kk.org/mt-files/festivo/): A calendar of all festivals. 

4. [Did She or Didn’t She? She Did, and She’ll Tell You Exactly How. (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/style/kylie-jenner-plastic-surgery.html): I am surprised it took so long to get here and not at all surprised who made it happen. Smartest family?

5. [New York City’s Best Chefs Pick Their Favorite Restaurants (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/dining/chef-nyc-best-restaurant-picks.html?)

6. [Is it any surprise he won? (The Pope)](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/can-american-pope-bring-us-style-fundraising-to-fix-vatican-finances-125060700226_1.html): 
    > As a bishop in Peru, Robert Prevost was often on the lookout for used cars that he could buy cheap and fix up himself for use in parishes around his diocese. With cars that were really broken down, he'd watch YouTube videos to learn how to fix them.

7. [I used to be a high-performing robot](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/i-used-to-be-a-high-performing-robot?) and [Maybe you’re not Actually Trying](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying). "Agency" is having a moment online as seen in all the "You can just do things" memes. Interesting. 

8. [LLMs in Kitchen?](https://x.com/kaseyklimes/status/1934417281674563915): I made Tofu with peanut sauce today based on a receipe created by Claude. Honestly, the proportions were off but it wasn't half bad. 
    > are LLMs 10X-ing anyone else in the kitchen? I am so much more confident cooking when I can ask infinite dumb questions and brainstorm ideas, backup plans, substitutes, etc. 

    > in the last couple weeks I’ve made jerk chicken with coconut rice and mango salsa, chipotle turkey tacos, honey-lime sriracha chicken & sesame snap peas, skillet-blistered tomato and ravioli, and a fancy dessert. some of these things were just me looking in the fridge and saying “uhh this is what I have, help me turn it into something good” and so far they’ve all been great.

    > I’m the stereotypical guy that knows how to make ~3 variations on a protein bowl and maybe ~2 nicer dishes for impressing girls when I was single and that’s about it. 

    > it’s fun feeling my agency expand and confidence quickly increase in this very practical domain. AI is great.

9. [Andrej Karpathy's Keynote at YC](https://x.com/ycombinator/status/1935496106957488566). Self recommending as some say. 

10. [Kitty Olympics](https://x.com/pabloprompt/status/1935822625663861192): AI Video is getting better. 

11. [Texan guy recites his electric bill like he’s a character in a William Faulkner novel.](https://x.com/tim_brannigan/status/1934364859006886070) Hilarious.

12. [AI is transforming Indian call centers.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/21/india-ai-bpo-call-centers/): 
    > For three years, Kartikeya Kumar hesitated before picking up the phone, anticipating another difficult conversation with another frustrated customer.

    > The call center agent, now 29, had tried everything to eliminate what a colleague called the “Indian-ism” in his accent. He mimicked the dialogue from Marvel movies and belted out songs by Metallica and Pink Floyd. Relief finally arrived in the form of artificial intelligence.

13. [Using AI Right Now: A Quick Guide by Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/using-ai-right-now-a-quick-guide): 
    > Every few months I put together a guide on which AI system to use. Since I last wrote my guide, however, there has been a subtle but important shift in how the major AI products work. Increasingly, it isn't about the best model, it is about the best overall system for most people. The good news is that picking an AI is easier than ever and you have three excellent choices. The challenge is that these systems are getting really complex to understand. I am going to try and help a bit with both.

14. [How cultures heal](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/audiences-prove-that-the-experts?): 
    > Every digital platform is flooding the market with short videos, but the audience is now spending more time with longform video—and by a huge margin.

15. [Flying on Frying Oil](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/06/flying-on-frying-oil.html): 
    > The noodle hawkers in Kuala Lumpur are getting a nice little bump in profit but who is going stall to stall to check that the oil is in fact used? And what counts as used? One fry or two? Clever entrepreneurs have cut out the middleman. Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila! Sustainable aviation fuel is contributing to deforestation in Malaysia. Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses. No surprise.

16. [The search for MH370 has resumed. (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/article/malaysia-airlines-missing-flight-mh370.html?). What a mystery. 

17. [Rick Perry: I’m dedicating my life to fighting for a psychedelic drug. (NYT)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/27/rick-perry-psychedelic-drug-ibogaine/): Yes, Rick Perry.
    > Marcus had lived with my wife, Anita, and me at the governor’s mansion after coming home from war. He was in constant pain from his injuries and dependent on opioids just to get through the day. He also drank heavily and used nicotine to cope with stress. Worse, he was carrying the burdens that come with war: grief, trauma and survivor’s guilt. For years, we tried to find him help. And for years, nothing worked. But after undergoing ibogaine treatment at a clinic in Mexico, Marcus came back changed. He no longer needed opioids. He hasn’t touched alcohol in years. He even quit chewing Copenhagen, a longtime habit.

18. [When your father is a swimming coach](https://x.com/thefigen_/status/1935279348145172889)

19. [Alpha School](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school?):
    > I first heard about Alpha in May 2024, and in the absence of randomized‑controlled clarity, I did what any moderately obsessive parent with three elementary-aged kids and an itch for data would do: I moved the family across the country to Austin for a year and ran the experiment myself (unfortunately, despite trying my best we never managed to have identical twins, so I stopped short of running a proper control group. My wife was less disappointed than I was).

20. [Your semi-regular reminder](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/childhood-and-education-11-the-art?) to subscribe to [Don't Worry About the Vase](https://thezvi.substack.com/).
