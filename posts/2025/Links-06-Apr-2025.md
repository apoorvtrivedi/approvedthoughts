1. [Myanmar Earthquake passing through Europe](https://x.com/zaibatsu/status/1905813574930382865?s=48): I experienced the shaking in Bangkok. First, I thought I was getting dizzy before the realization struck. It was kind of disorienting walking down the stairs of the building, periodically feeling dizzy. It didn't feel real, almost as if it was just a drill or a joke. 

2. [AI vs. Human: Odysseus Translation](https://x.com/nabeelqu/status/1906820351457460415): I, too, preferred the AI version. Even if you don't agree with the ranking, it is clearly good enough. 

3. [Tough out there for kids](https://x.com/zach_yadegari/status/1906859987105636667): Hard to understand the rejection ratio. I was originally going to link to a thread by a university professor with experience in admissions, critiquing his personal essay but she has locked her account now, I assume after it went viral. If I recall correctly, she felt his essay did not show the right attitude for various reasons. [Many on twitter](https://x.com/paulnovosad/status/1907417539396632590?s=46) (and I) disagreed but even if you agree with her take, the essay highlights a very impressive person (and seems factually accurate). So I struggle to understand the rejection ratio. 

4. [If he can fall for a phishing attack, so can you](https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/) and they are only going to get more sophisticated. Be careful out there and step up your safety protocols. 

5. [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/): I have yet to fully read this but it is a lot more "optimistic" on AI progress than I am right now and at least somewhat scary.
