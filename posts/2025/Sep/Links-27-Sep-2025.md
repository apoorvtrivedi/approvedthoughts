2. [YouTube Star MrBeast Is Building an Entertainment Empire - Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/2025.09.24-052808/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-09-22/youtube-star-mrbeast-is-building-an-entertainment-empire): Beast Industries sounds like a regular corporation with regular corporate problems. 
    > Right now, however, Beast Industries is hemorrhaging money. It’s had three years of losses, including more than $110 million in 2024. The viral videos account for all of it, overwhelming the profits from Feastables. Donaldson has been spending between $3 million and $4 million on every video he produces for the main YouTube channel, most of which lose money. In 2023, Beast spent $10 million to $15 million shooting videos it never released to the public because they weren’t up to its standards. He also lost tens of millions of dollars producing Beast Games, a popular show for Amazon Prime Video in which 1,000 people competed for $10 million by, among other things, moving a 10,000-pound boulder.
