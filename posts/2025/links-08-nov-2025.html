<p>I&#39;m worried that they put co-pilot in Excel because Excel is the beast that drives our entire economy and do you know who has tamed that beast?</p>



<p>Brenda.</p>



<p>Who is Brenda?</p>



<p>She is a mid-level employee in every finance department, in every business across this stupid nation and the Excel goddess herself descended from the heavens, kissed Brenda on her forehead and the sweat from Brenda&#39;s brow is what allows us to do capitalism. [...]</p>



<p>She&#39;s gonna birth that formula for a financial report and then she&#39;s gonna send that financial report to a higher up and he&#39;s gonna need to make a change to the report and normally he would have sent it back to Brenda but he&#39;s like oh I have AI and AI is probably like smarter than Brenda and then the AI is gonna fuck it up real bad and he won&#39;t be able to recognize it because he doesn&#39;t understand Excel because AI hallucinates.</p>



<p>You know who&#39;s not hallucinating?</p>



<p>Brenda.</p>

<p>Jasmine Mitchell, the winner of the 16th season of “The Great British Baking Show,” stood out in the competition mainly for her creations — including a cake that was nearly four feet long — but also for her statement earrings, brightly colored outfits and her shiny, hairless head.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Optimism is a psychological attribute characterized as the general expectation that good things will happen, or the belief that the future will be favorable because one can control important outcomes. Previous studies reported that more optimistic individuals are less likely to suffer from chronic diseases and die prematurely. Our results further suggest that optimism is specifically related to 11 to 15% longer life span, on average, and to greater odds of achieving “exceptional longevity,” that is, living to the age of 85 or beyond. These relations were independent of socioeconomic status, health conditions, depression, social integration, and health behaviors (e.g., smoking, diet, and alcohol use). Overall, findings suggest optimism may be an important psychosocial resource for extending life span in older adults.</p>

This year it rained in Indore through early November. In 90&#39;s and even early&#39;00s anything beyond mid-September was extremely unusual. But is it catastrophic? Will it become so? Maybe not. </p>

<p>Depending on how much weight one gives to individual studies and models, versus broader literature reviews and scientific assessments, you can find some evidence for some intensification of some features of tropical cyclone behavior and frequency in some places. But what you won’t find, Norris’ reference to a single unpublished and unpeer-reviewed study notwithstanding, is good evidence that climate change has affected those things very much.</p>

<p>Investigators confirmed that the caller was actually Carl Avinger and that the defendant was not. Nor was he Carl E. Avinger, John Stamp, Bobby Jackson, Craig Taylor, Graig T
 aylor, Anthony S. Williams, Kevin C. Windley, Kevin Windleg, Corey Blake Duncan, Marco Ferrari, Marco Ferrare, Elvis Taylor or Elvis Teller — names he had used to commit dozens of crimes across the city, on Long Island and as far away as Oklahoma over the last three decades, according to court, jail and prison records, and internal Police Department documents obtained by The New York Times.</p>



<p>In the months that followed, Melinda Katz, the Queens district attorney, and her prosecutors from the housing bureau unearthed more information about the man whose roughly half-century life had been defined by deceit. But there was one fact they had yet to discover: his name.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: AI now solves university assignments perfectly in minutes. Students often use LLMs as a crutch rather than as a tutor, getting answers without understanding. To address these problems, I propose a barbell strategy: pure fundamentals (no AI) on one end, full-on AI projects on the other, with no mushy middle. Universities should focus on fundamentals.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://fly.io/blog/everyone-write-an-agent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You Should Write An Agent</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some concepts are easy to grasp in the abstract. Boiling water: apply heat and wait. Others you really need to try. You only think you understand how a bicycle works, until you learn to ride one.</p>



<p>There are big ideas in computing that are easy to get your head around. The AWS S3 API. It’s the most important storage technology of the last 20 years, and it’s like boiling water. Other technologies, you need to get your feet on the pedals first.</p>



<p>LLM agents are like that.</p>



<p>People have wildly varying opinions about LLMs and agents. But whether or not they’re snake oil, they’re a big idea. You don’t have to like them, but you should want to be right about them. To be the best hater (or stan) you can be.</p>



<p>So that’s one reason you should write an agent. But there’s another reason that’s even more persuasive, and that’s</p>

<p> One thing I have noticing recently is that there are a ton of interesting blogs out there. Of course, there is substack, but there is a lot more and of extremely high quality except that my discovery model has broken down. Twitter / Google are no longer the best discovery option. I would like a better solution to this problem.</p>
