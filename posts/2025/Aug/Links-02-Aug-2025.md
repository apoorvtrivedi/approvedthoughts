1. [Philosopher–Builder Summer Reads](https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/philosopherbuilder-summer-reads-2025https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/philosopherbuilder-summer-reads-2025): 
    > These aren't generic "tech books." They're works that can shape how serious builders think about what they're creating and why.

    [And the original essay.](https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/the-philosopher-builder)

2. [DOGE builds AI tool to cut 50 percent of federal regulations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/26/doge-ai-tool-cut-regulations-trump/): 
    > The tool, called the “DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool,” is supposed to analyze roughly 200,000 federal regulations to determine which can be eliminated because they are no longer required by law, according to a PowerPoint presentation obtained by The Post that is dated July 1 and outlines DOGE’s plans. Roughly 100,000 of those rules would be deemed worthy of trimming, the PowerPoint estimates — mostly through the automated tool with some staff feedback. The PowerPoint also suggests the AI tool will save the United States trillions of dollars by reducing compliance requirements, slashing the federal budget and unlocking unspecified “external investment.”

    A worthy goal for DOGE and possibly the right use of AI. If done well. 

3. [America's AI Action Plan Is Pretty Good](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/americas-ai-action-plan-is-pretty): 
    > Otherwise, while this is far from a perfect plan or the plan I would choose, on the substance it is a good plan, a positive plan, with many unexpectedly good plans within it. There is a lot of attention to detail in ways those I’ve asked say reflect people who actually know what they are doing, which was by no means something to be taken for granted. It is hard to imagine that a much better plan could have been approved given who was doing the approving.

5. Two [long](https://arjunramani.com/india-dispatch.html) & [good](https://andrewbatson.com/2025/07/27/india-and-the-invidious-comparison-with-china/) pieces on India this week though I have yet to fully read both. 

5. [Jhanas](https://nintil.com/jhanas/) and [Jhourney](https://www.jhourney.io/): 
    > So I went down to the beach. "Kinda nice", I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had 'the right size', their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up ("Huh? I thought"). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling "It's... always been like this!!!!" "What the fuck??!" followed by "This is too much!! Too much!!!". The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what "painfully beautiful" means for the first time in my life. I had to look away. I calmed a bit. I walked a few steps and looked back. The exact same thing happened. "It's reproducible, hihihihi", and I started laughing. Then I found a log to sit on, calm down, and look back at the ocean. Now it wasn't overwhelming, but "kinda nice" was now "fucking amazing".

    To do list. 

6. [Yes, Adam Sandler really is a pickup basketball god (NYT Paywall)](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/1681634/2020/03/18/this-man-is-a-pickup-basketball-god/?source=user_shared_article):
    > Jackson was struck by the man’s attire: extra-baggy shorts and an extra-baggy yellow T-shirt. “I’m trying to figure out: Does he buy clothes? Did he buy them and then just stop buying them? His clothes really might have been from 2008.” It soon became apparent, however, that the guy could play. He was a true court general. He impressed Jackson with his basketball IQ.

8. [Life in deep](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/07/30/deep-sea-discovery-pacific-ocean/):    
    > When her three-person submersible descended more than 30,000 feet into one of the Pacific Ocean’s deepest trenches, Mengran Du wasn’t sure what they would find.

    > What she saw, she recalled, was “unbelievable”: Dense clusters of tubeworms with tentacles tinged bloodred, jutting up like skyscrapers. Iridescent snails scaling the worms, like window washers. Bristly, white creatures wriggling between them like rush-hour commuters trying to get home for dinner.
