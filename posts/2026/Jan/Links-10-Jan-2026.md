For the last 2-3 weeks I had been noticing a "vibe-shift" about a jump in the abilities of the leading LLMs. This week that conversation took center stage as many blog posts and tweets raving about the enhanced abilities of Claud Code, especially when using the command line interfact went viral. I have not had the chance to test it out myself, as I am pre-occupied with the family's upcoming relocation. However, after that, this is top of the list for me now and all links but two below are on this topic. I recommend everyone go down this rabbit hole.

1. [Can Timothée Chalamet Break This Oscar Curse? (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/07/movies/timothee-chalamet-michael-b-jordan-oscar-curse.html): Woke comes full-circle with NYT worrying about unfair treatment of young, white, male actors?
    > For nearly a century, Oscar voters have been reluctant to hand the best-actor prize to young men, almost always opting to reward more seasoned performers.

    > Though Oscar voters have no qualms about rewarding young actresses, they traditionally want to see more mileage on their men.

2. [The Tyranny of the Complainers](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/the-tyranny-of-the-complainers.html): 
    > In 2015, for example, 6,852 of the 8,760 complaints submitted to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport originated from one residence in the affluent Foxhall neighborhood of northwest Washington, DC. The residents of that particular house called Reagan National to express irritation about aircraft noise an average of almost 19 times per day during 2015.

3. [A Personal Panopticon (via MR)](https://x.com/mollycantillon/status/2008918474006122936): A great summary.
    > A few months ago, I started running my life out of Claude Code. Not out of intention to do so, it was just the place where everything met. And it just kept working. Empires are won by conquest. What keeps them standing is something much quieter. Before a king can tax, he must count. Before he can conscript, he must locate. Before he can rule, he must see. Legibility is the precondition for governance…

    > The first thing Claude solved was product blindness. NOX now runs on a cron job: pulling Amplitude, cross-referencing GitHub, and pointing me to what needs building. It handles A/B testing, generates winning copy, and has turned customer support into a fully autonomous department.

    > Once I saw this was possible, I chased it everywhere. Email, hitting inbox zero for the first time ever, with auto-drafted replies for everything inbound. Workouts, accommodating horrendously erratic travel schedules. Sleep, built a projector wired to my WHOOP after exactly six hours that wakes me with my favorite phrases. Subscriptions, found and returned $2000 I didn’t know I was paying. The dozen SFMTA citations I’d ignored, the action items I’d procrastinated into oblivion. People are using it to, I discovered, run vending machines, home automation systems, and keep plants alive.

    > The feeling is hard to name. It is the violent gap between how blind you were and how obvious everything feels now with an observer that reads all the feeds, catches what you’ve unconsciously dropped, notices patterns across domains you’d kept stubbornly separate, and—crucially—tells you what to do about it.

    > My personal finances are now managed in the terminal. Overnight it picks the locks of brokerages that refuse to talk to each other, pulls congressional and hedge fund disclosures, Polymarket odds, X sentiment, headlines and 10-Ks from my watchlist. Every morning, a brief gets added in ~/𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚎𝚜. Last month it flagged Rep. Fields buying NFLX shares. Three weeks later, the Warner Bros deal. I don’t always trade, sometimes I argue with the thesis. But I’m never tracking fifteen tabs at 6am anymore.

    > It feels borderline unfair seeing around corners, being in ten places at once, surveilling yourself with the attention span of a thousand clones.

    > A panopticon still, but the tower belongs to you.

4. [Claude Codes](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/claude-codes): The definitive guide to the developments and the conversation, including some useful guides. 
    > Claude Code with Opus 4.5 is so hot right now. The cool kids use it for everything.

    > They definitely use it for coding, often letting it write all of their code.

    > They also increasingly use it for everything else one can do with a computer.

5. [Toby Lutke, Founder & CEO, Spotify](https://x.com/tobi/status/2009311882553765914): Do endorsments come any stronger than this?

6. [Claude Code Tutorials](https://x.com/petergyang/status/2002402550570758283): Not tried. Saving here for later.

7. [Among the Agents](https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/among-the-agents?): Examples and implications. 

8. [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521?s=20): Don't worry if you feel you are behind. So does Andrej and he's among the best out there. 

9. [Self-Driving Cars](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/advancements-in-self-driving-cars): The robots are coming too. What a time. 

10. [The Final Offshoring](https://finaloffshoring.com/The_Final_Offshoring.pdf): More on robots. 
    > Thus, why should the future be any different? Why should one expect a sudden, dramatic wave of robotics working not just in the coming decade, but the coming handful of years? Why should
the curse of Moravec’s Paradox suddenly break? 

    > The standard answer a savvy technologist would give is that increasingly capable AI video and world models will serve as a “base,” providing real-world understanding, while deployments,
whether through teleoperation, data gloves, or egocentric capture, will generate an additional data flywheel. This has already led to interesting emergent behaviors: absorbing egocentric data,
tactile sensing, and generalization across environments. And we’re about to scale everything up by 100x. Long robotics. Things will be big soon.

 > I think this is mostly correct, but let me add some nuance around both why to be bullish and two of the challenges that robotics faces today.
