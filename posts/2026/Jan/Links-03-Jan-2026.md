1. [‘I Was Just So Naïve’: Inside Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Break With Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/magazine/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-maga-split.html?unlocked_article_code=1.AVA.0XIc.Rf3rYSGTA4Nx&smid=nytcore-ios-share): Starting the new year with a revelation - people can surprise you. 
    > "“After Charlie died, I realized that I’m part of this toxic culture. I really started looking at my faith. I wanted to be more like Christ.”

2. [Kazuyoshi Miura, 58, signs with new club to extend record-breaking soccer career - The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6928990/2025/12/30/kazuyoshi-miura-age-oldest-player/?source=user_shared_article): 
    > He’s known as “King Kazu” in Japan and has played 40 professional seasons dating back to the mid-1980s. He started in Brazil’s Serie A, the country’s top division, with Santos in 1986. He has had brief, varying spells abroad over the course of his career, in Australia, Italy, and Croatia, all before 2000, when he returned to Japan for good, firstly with Kyoto Purple Sanga in 1999.

3. [Beginner’s Guide to the Mahabharata and Ramayana](https://www.sammendelsohn.com/post/beginner-s-guide-to-the-mahabharata-and-ramayana): 
    > Do you desire to know the stories of India’s two great epics, but are intimidated by the massive tomes with hundreds of characters and thousands of pages full of sentences like this: “Ugrasrava, the son of Lomaharshana, surnamed Sauti, well-versed in the Puranas, bending with humility, one day approached the great sages of rigid vows, sitting at their ease, who had attended the twelve years’ sacrifice of Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, in the forest of Naimisha.”

    > Well if so, I’ve got just the guide for you!

4. [The Prison Of Financial Mediocrity](https://x.com/systematicls/status/2004900241745883205): I saw this a fair bit on my timeline. The response in 4.1 makes a lot more sense to me though. 
    > A 25-year-old making $70k is constantly fed content from people their age making $2mn, living in Bali, "working" four hours a day. The baseline for "enough" keeps moving.

    > You never catch up. No matter what you achieve, social media will show you what you're missing. The spread between your life and the life you "should" have is maintained algorithmically, forever uncollapsible.

    > So you have AI shrinking your timeline AND social media ensuring you never feel like you've arrived. The pressure to escape, NOW, FAST, before it's too late, compounds daily.
