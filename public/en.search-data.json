{"/about/":{"data":{"":"","#":"Welcome to Approved Thoughts First up, why “Approved Thoughts”? I have spent more than 20 years in East Asia and “Approv” is how my name is most commonly spelled and pronounced here.\nI remember working for FedEx in 2003. My job was to approve pricing for large contracts. Every so often I got an email from a salesperson in the Philippines or Thailand that just said “Approv, pls approve.” My frequent response? “Approved.”\nApproved Thoughts also has a vaguely sinister connotation that makes me feel cool. It’s a low bar, but let’s face it, as a middle-aged man starting yet another Substack, clearing a higher one may be beyond my abilities.\nWhat is Approved Thoughts going to be about? Let’s start by addressing the elephant (or the ant) in the room - this is a new year’s resolution so there isn’t some grand plan that I have in mind. This newsletter was inspired by this post by Simon Willison that I came across recently:\n…blogging doesn’t have to be about unique insights. The value is in writing frequently and having something to show for it over time—worthwhile even if you don’t attract much of an audience (or any audience at all).\nSo the plan, to the extent there is one, is to just write. Once a week, maybe some links I found interesting or some tip or trick I found useful or a short comment on what I am thinking about.\nGiven my reading habits and interests at the moment, I expect a lot of what I include will come either from Marginal Revolution or Don’t Worry About the Vase. These are both such high value sources that I think everyone should follow them anyway. So go ahead and do that first.

High fixed cost to set up, hard to create a product differentiation that users care about (other than price), lots of competitors entering, at least in part due to the “prestige” of owning one. Lots of utility for consumers but hardly any profit for producers.\nAn LLM with an infinite context window, one that can contain all my life, will be an entirely different product than an LLM with a limited context window. You can never have enough when it comes to context windows.\nNotwithstanding 1, “personality” makes a huge difference in the experience of working with an LLM and the ability to create the right one could determine whether a model can dominate a market or a niche. Claude Sonnet 3.5 absolutely had than special sauce in my experience. We need a lot more of it.\nThis.:\nI don’t see how we’re going to avoid a situation where the internet become lousy with AI-created, pseudo academic writing filled with made up facts and quotes, which will then get cemented into “knowledge” as those articles become the training fodder for future models.\nBut combine it with the fact that if we all start getting our answers from LLMs, the online content \u0026 ad based business model goes caput and then what is the incentive for people to put up good content on the web? None.\nBut anyone who has good proprietary, verified, high-quality data \u0026 content will potentially control the value for the customer even as base LLMs become a commodity. Therefore does more data and content start going behind the paywall? If it doesn’t it becomes training data and cannot be monetized."},"title":"A few thoughts on LLMs"},"/posts/links-01-mar-2025/":{"data":{"":" A.I. and Vibecoding Helped Me Create My Own Software: The limitation here is my imagination.\nHumanoid Robots are coming.

Maybe if there is something really interesting or shocking, a comment to my SO.\nSo it is a jarring to see that the impact of a brief scene stuck with the actor for years after the fact.\nThese days there is enough nudity on screen that most of us are desensitized to seeing it and I hope the actors are too, to performing them. Even in 2006 or 2012, when maybe it was less common, I would not have imagined an actor, and especially an American1 actor, would be so traumatized by such a scene.\nMaybe it is because she grew up in a time when that was a much bigger deal that it was harder on her. Perhaps actors like her were the trailblazers and paid a price and it is easier for actors now.\nIt is, however, possible to imagine a possibility where being naked on screen is traumatizing, no matter how common and acceptable. According to Claude, the “being naked in public” dream genre is common across cultures and age groups and more common in adoloscents.\nIf that is the case I shudder to imagine the cost of all the content on Netflix and other services in a few years time.\nThe report also has a bit on another scene she was not happy about.

I asked yesterday for recommendations on great detective franchises for easy reading in stressful times, and you delivered. I’ve had so many suggestions that this will need to come in installments.\nTo start, the name you’ve recommended most often, and with greatest enthusiasm, is Michael Connelly and his Harry Bosch series (the detective loves jazz and lives in the LA hills).\nOther entrants includes the Dave Robicheaux series by James Lee Burke (set in Louisiana and starting with The Neon Rain), Arnaldur Indridason’s “really good, bleak Icelandic stuff” (try Jar City first). Volker Kutscher’s Babylon Berlin series, set in Weimar Germany. Robert van Gulik’s Judge Dee stories (written some decades ago and set in Ancient China — try Willow Pattern). Also the Martin Beck books set in 1960-70s Sweden and written over 10 years by Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo — a husband and wife team, and godparents of Scandinavian noir (Roseanna is recommended) and the Harry Hole books by Jo Nesbo, set in Norway.\nTo be clear, I didn’t mention Raymond Chandler’s Marlowe books because I’ve already read all of them. If you’ve never dipped into Chandler, you have a treat in store — perhaps start with The Big Sleep. And as more than one of you said Connelly was as good as Chandler, I definitely want to read one of his. I’ll have plenty more suggestions tomorrow. Please, if you have any more to recommend, let me know.\nHerewith another installment in our crowd-sourced tour of great detective fiction franchises. You might want to try: Abir Mukherjee’s Wyndham and Banerjee series is set in India under the British Raj; the Canadian writer Eric Wright’s John Salter series, set in Toronto; Philip Kerr’s Bernie Gunther series, set in Nazi Germany; the Whitstable Pearl mysteries by Julie Wassmer (who used to be a scriptwriter for Eastenders so there are plenty of cliffhangers); Andrea Camilleri’s Inspector Montalbano series, featuring Sicily and plenty of great food; and Death of a Red Heroine, the first of the Inspector Chen series by Qiu Xiaolong in contemporary Shanghai. This comes highly recommended by Andy Rothman of Sinology, long one of my favorite guides to all things China, and by remarkable coincidence I had picked up a copy of this book from a neighborhood bookshelf earlier this week.

There is plenty of alpha out there, if you know where and how to look. Also, brute force is underrated. Sadly behind a paywall and there’s lot more to it than the gist below:\nIn Texas, as in many states, most people who play the lottery go to a store with a machine, choose numbers, then walk away with a ticket. Back in 2023, Texas also allowed online lottery-ticket vendors to set up shops to print tickets for their customers.\nMarantelli’s team recruited one such seller, struggling startup Lottery.com, to help with the logistics of buying and printing the millions of tickets. Like all lotto retailers, it would collect a 5% sales commission. The Texas Lottery Commission allowed dozens of the terminals that print tickets to be delivered to the four workshops set up by the team.\nThat April 19, the commission announced that there had been no winner in that day’s drawing. The next drawing, with an even larger pot, would be three days later, on a Saturday. The group sprang into action.\nThe printing operation ran day and night. The team had converted each number combination into a QR code. Crew members scanned the codes into the terminals using their phones, then scrambled to organize all the tickets in boxes such that they could easily locate the winning numbers.\nThe game called for picking six numbers from 1 to 54. For a pro gambler, some sets of numbers—such as 1,2,3,4,5,6—aren’t worth picking because so many other players choose them, which would split the pot. Marantelli’s operation bought 99.3% of the possibilities.\nMoney moved to Lottery.com from Ranogajec’s accounts—held under the name John Wilson—in the Isle of Man, a tax haven off the U.K. coast, taking a circuitous route via an escrow account at a Detroit law firm, according to people familiar with the transfers and bank statements reviewed by the Journal.\nThe crew hit the jackpot that Saturday. One of their tickets was the sole winner.\nThe Moon Should Be a Computer: Love the ambition.

Jeffrey was scheduled for open-heart surgery and transferred to the nearest children’s hospital.\nIn those days, surgery for PDA was invasive. Holes were cut on either side of Jeffrey’s tiny neck and chest to insert a catheter into his jugular vein. His little body was opened from breastbone to backbone, his flesh lifted aside, ribs pried apart, and a blood vessel near his heart tied off, and then all the tissues were stitched back together.\nBaby Jeffrey felt everything – every incision, every internal repair, every stitch.

After Jeffrey died, Lawson called his doctor for reassurance. Surely, she thought, her child had been given something for the pain.\n“The anesthesiologist informed me that she had not used any anesthesia or analgesia on Jeffrey,” Lawson wrote in an account of her son’s experience.

Here I use a net “happiness” measure, which is percentage Yes less percentage No with Maybe treated as zero.\nAverage happiness is around +20 on this scale for all respondents from 1972 to the last pre-pandemic survey (2018). However, there is a wide gap of around 30 points between married and unmarried respondents.\nThis “marital premium” is this paper’s subject. I describe how this premium varies across and within population groups. These include standard socio demographics (age, sex, race education, income) and more. I find little variety and thereby surface a notable regularity in US socio demography: there is a substantial marital premium for every group and subgroup I analyze, and this premium is usually close to the overall 30-point average.\nThis holds not just for standard characteristics but also for those directly related to marriage like children and sex (and sex preference). I also find a “cohabitation premium”, but it is much smaller (10 points) than the marital premium. The analysis is mainly visual, and there is inevitably some interesting variety across seventeen figures, such as a 5-point increase in recent years."},"title":"Links: Week of 22 Mar 2025"},"/posts/links-23-feb-2025/":{"data":{"":" 50 years of Travel Tips: Some great tips.\nFor the best travel experiences you need either a lot of money, or a lot of time.

Despite the click-baity headline and not the most objective tone, the scientific brekthrough here is worth cheering.\nCalled in ovo sexing, it determines the sex of the chick embryo long before it hatches, allowing the producers to get rid of the male eggs and hatch only the females.\nThis is important because:\nI had no idea that while the Ladies enjoyed shelter and sunshine, fresh bugs and freedom, their newborn brothers faced a gruesome fate shared by 6.5 billion male chicks around the world each year. These male birds can’t lay eggs but also aren’t raised for meat. Because they come from egg-laying breeds, they don’t grow big or fast enough to be used for food. So they are ground up alive or gassed to death.\nQuestions about the Future of AI by Dwarkesh Patel: I haven’t read most of this but what I have is great.\nAnother important question about AI by Radek Sienkiewicz : Why do AI company logos look like buttholes? Click the link. They really do.\nIn a year will this still make news?:\nAustralian Radio Network (ARN), the media company behind KIIS, as well as Gold and iHeart, used an AI-generated female Asian host to broadcast 4 hours of midweek radio, without disclosing it.\nThis probably still will:\n“It seems very odd that CADA hired a new ethnically-diverse woman to their youth station and then just forgot to tell anyone.”\nIt’s notable because ARN is the whitest thing in media since the Night King and his throng of walkers on Game of Thrones. The network is also home of Australia’s most expensive, complained about and censured radio show, Kyle and Jackie O.\nPenn Station’s Not-So-Secret Other Life: The People’s Dance Studio:\n“Penn Station is first and foremost a transportation hub,” said Aaron Donovan, the deputy communications director for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “But you know, as long as folks abide by the rules and regulations that govern the use of the space and don’t block platforms or interfere with passenger flows, we generally don’t have any problem with what’s going on.”\nWatching o3 guess a photo’s location is surreal, dystopian and wildly entertaining by Simon Willison:\nFirst, this is really fun. Watching the model’s thought process as it churns through the photo, pans and zooms and discusses different theories about where it could be is wildly entertaining. It’s like living in an episode of CSI.\nIt’s also deeply dystopian. Technology can identify locations from photographs now. It’s vitally important that people understand how easy this is—if you have any reason at all to be concerned about your safety, you need to know that any photo you share—even a photo as bland as my example above—could be used to identify your location."},"title":"Links: Week of 26 Apr 2025"},"/posts/links-30-mar-2025/":{"data":{"":" Unintentionally hilarious:\nThe Danish Defense Ministry also plans to fund two more dogsled teams to protect the 375,000-square-mile Northeast Greenland National Park, the largest in the world. These would be the hardcore Sirius patrols, viewed by the Danes as the Navy SEALs of the Arctic, which began operations during World War II.\nTwo. Not one.\nHow to vibe code?: A fairly decent app and when you see his conversations with ChatGPT, its mostly just plain english. Does a programming background help. Sure, but you can go quite far without any. Here are the actual conversations:\na. Starting the app\nb. Enhancements\nc. More enhancements\nd. Deploy to iPhone\ne. The actual App\nWhy we ended up homeschooling:\nTL;DR: homeschooling makes it much easier to individualize education, which makes it more efficient and meaningful.\nTokyo vs. Rest of Japan:\nThis is called the sponge city effect in my little world of demographics. In a declining region we often see the biggest city soaking up population since jobs and health services etc cluster in a single area rather than spreading out. Japan has been shrinking for three decades while Tokyo happily grows.\nHow Much Would You Need to be Paid to Live on a Deserted Island for 1.5 Years and Do Nothing but Kill Seals?: What it says on the label.\nBest take:\npeople are rightfully upset about this atlantic story because it gets at a truly alarming issue: being added to large, ongoing group texts without consent\n😂\nTrue that!:\nYour brain will invent fake problems for you if you don’t go out and find real ones\nI don’t know if this is the right path, but its the right destination "},"title":"Links: Week of 30 Mar 2025"},"/posts/links-9-feb-2025/":{"data":{"":" Translating with LLMs: A fantastic guide from a professional translator on how he is using LLMs to do his job better.\nFor my day to day queries, I simply ask Claude, like I would ask a colleague or a friend and it just works. But for professional work, correctly prompting the LLMs improves the quality of output significantly. I hope to find (and create) more such examples.\nWisdom: Wisdom II: A lot of AI cheerleading takes this form. Yes, you can just do things. I have also thought and posted along those lines. But as Gergely points out, the hard thing in building a payment system is not the code - its fraud, AML, KYC, tax, reporting, reconcilliation…\nThat is true for most other hard things too. The hard thing in pharma is not finding the compound but getting the trials and approvals done. The hard thing in politics in not the manifesto but the consensus.\nTarriffs and Modern Supply Chains: Tarriffs are more disruptive than I thought.\nHow My Dad Reconciled His God and His Gay Son: Beautiful.\nThis is me with my dad, Bill White. For decades, he has been an evangelical pastor. Before I was born, he wrote a letter to my future wife. He didn’t know what we both do now: that I’m gay. When I came out nearly 16 years later, it shook his faith and fractured his church. But it never separated us. I wanted to understand how. So I read his journals.\nStrongly endorse:\nOne of the reasons making things is satisfying is that it’s a concrete demonstration of the notion that you can have some amount of control over your environment and circumstances. Passive media consumption is the opposite of that.\nShould you value the life of your brother more than that of a stranger?:\nBut again, this is a distraction from any real issue! Oh, you should value the life of your brother more than a stranger? You don’t say? I’m hearing this for the first time! Now let’s kill five million foreign children to fund one sixth of a broadband boondoggle.\nI am happy to “concede” that if you face a choice between saving a stranger and saving your brother, save your brother! Or your cousin, or your great-uncle, or your seven-times-great-grand-nephew-twice-removed. I’ll “concede” all of this, immediately, because it’s all fake; none of your relatives were ever in any danger. The only point of this whole style of philosophical discussion is so that you can sound wise as you say “Ah, but is not saving your brother more important than saving a complete stranger?” then sentence five million strangers to death for basically no benefit while your brother continues to be a successful real estate agent in Des Moines.\nWhen will I be able to write so well?"},"title":"Links: Week of Feb 09 2025"},"/posts/test/":{"data":{"":"","basic-text#Basic text":"This is plain text.","image-test#Image test":"","template-test#Template test":"The title of this page is: {{ .Title }}\nThe current date is: {{ now.Format “January 2, 2006” }}"},"title":"Template Test"},"/posts/update-12-apr-2025/":{"data":{"":"After a few more iterations with Claude, the website is looking a lot better but it isn’t working that much better.
