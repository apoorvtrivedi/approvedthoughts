<p><a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital hygiene</a> by <a href="https://karpathy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrej Karpathy</a>: I discovered this just a little late to include in the last weeks post, where it would have been the perfect companion piece along with <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> on getting phished.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a fair bit of experimentation, I&rsquo;ve built a Claude project that handles all the repeatable high-effort prompt engineering (like source selection) for you. It asks for your preferences, clarifies what you need, and produces a well-structured prompt that you can then feed into any DR model.</p>

<p>Two high-value excerpts from <a href="https://www.twitter.com/johnauthers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Authers</a> Bloomberg newsletters:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here follows a crowd-sourced literary tip. I asked yesterday for recommendations on great detective franchises for easy reading in stressful times, and you delivered. I’ve had so many suggestions that this will need to come in installments.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>To start, the name you’ve recommended most often, and with greatest enthusiasm, is <strong>Michael Connelly</strong> and his Harry Bosch series (the detective loves jazz and lives in the LA hills).</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Other entrants includes the Dave Robicheaux series by <strong>James Lee Burke</strong> (set in Louisiana and starting with The Neon Rain), <strong>Arnaldur Indridason’s</strong> “really good, bleak Icelandic stuff” (try Jar City first). <strong>Volker Kutscher’s</strong> Babylon Berlin series, set in Weimar Germany. <strong>Robert van Gulik’s</strong> Judge Dee stories (written some decades ago and set in Ancient China — try Willow Pattern).  Also the Martin Beck books set in 1960-70s Sweden and written over 10 years by <strong>Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo</strong> — a husband and wife team, and godparents of Scandinavian noir (Roseanna is recommended) and the Harry Hole books by <strong>Jo Nesbo</strong>, set in Norway.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>To be clear, I didn’t mention <strong>Raymond Chandler’s</strong> Marlowe books because I’ve already read all of them. If you’ve never dipped into Chandler, you have a treat in store — perhaps start with The Big Sleep. And as more than one of you said Connelly was as good as Chandler, I definitely want to read one of his. I’ll have plenty more suggestions tomorrow. Please, if you have any more to recommend, let me know.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Herewith another installment in our crowd-sourced tour of great detective fiction franchises. You might want to try: <strong>Abir Mukherjee’s</strong> Wyndham and Banerjee series is set in India under the British Raj; the Canadian writer <strong>Eric Wright’s</strong> John Salter series, set in Toronto; <strong>Philip Kerr’s</strong> Bernie Gunther series, set in Nazi Germany; the Whitstable Pearl mysteries by <strong>Julie Wassmer</strong> (who used to be a scriptwriter for Eastenders so there are plenty of cliffhangers); <strong>Andrea Camilleri’s</strong> Inspector Montalbano series, featuring Sicily and plenty of great food; and Death of a Red Heroine, the first of the Inspector Chen series by <strong>Qiu Xiaolong</strong> in contemporary Shanghai. This comes highly recommended by Andy Rothman of Sinology, long one of my favorite guides to all things China, and by remarkable coincidence I had picked up a copy of this book from a neighborhood bookshelf earlier this week. So that’s what I’ll read next. More detectives next week.</p>

  <p>The first generation of AI-powered products (often called “AI Wrapper” apps, because they “just” are wrapped around an LLM API) were quickly brought to market by small teams of engineers, picking off the low-hanging problems. But today, I’m seeing teams of domain experts wading into the field, hiring a programmer or two to handle the implementation, while the experts themselves provide the prompts, data labeling, and evaluations.</p>

          <p>After a few more iterations with Claude, the website is looking a lot better but it isn&rsquo;t working that much better. The Archives link on top right throws up a poorly formatted page.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The huge, black  &ldquo;Approved Thoughts&rdquo; at the top of the page and the smaller blue version in the header are redundant.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> There are many other issues to be fixed.</p>
<p>I also managed to get the CMS set up so that I could login and see all the posts in the CMS.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It is useless though because the posts I create there do not show up on the site. So there is some solid debugging needed before I can get more ambitious here. Still I am quite chuffed that I have this set up and working.</p>
<p>Between the markets and a potential relocation, I have not devoted any time to this website. Hopefully that changes soon.</p>
<p>I have also decided another project I want to try my hand at. More as I get started.</p>
<p><strong>Thought for the day:</strong> If you ask &ldquo;do I feel like doing this now&rdquo;, you won&rsquo;t do it. Certainly not regularly. First, figure out how to stop the question.</p>

  <p>Two weeks after his birth, Jeffrey’s health took a turn for the worse: He developed a heart defect common in premature infants – patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA. Jeffrey was scheduled for open-heart surgery and transferred to the nearest children’s hospital.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>In those days, surgery for PDA was invasive. Holes were cut on either side of Jeffrey’s tiny neck and chest to insert a catheter into his jugular vein. His little body was opened from breastbone to backbone, his flesh lifted aside, ribs pried apart, and a blood vessel near his heart tied off, and then all the tissues were stitched back together.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Baby Jeffrey felt everything – every incision, every internal repair, every stitch. The medical team had not given their fragile patient any drugs, any comfort, anything to protect him from the excruciating pain of open-heart surgery – just a paralyzing agent to keep him still during the procedure.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Five weeks later, Jeffrey passed away.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the days before her child’s death, Jill Lawson learned a shocking fact: Anesthetizing babies for surgery was not common practice. After Jeffrey died, Lawson called his doctor for reassurance. Surely, she thought, her child had been given something for the pain.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The anesthesiologist informed me that she had not used any anesthesia or analgesia on Jeffrey,” Lawson wrote in an account of her son’s experience. The doctor told the grieving mother it hadn’t even occurred to her to do so because it had never been demonstrated that babies can feel pain.</p>

  <p>And I also wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if, in five years, the best models we have are better than the ones we have today, but only in “normal” ways where costs continue to decrease considerably and capabilities continue to get better but there&rsquo;s no fundamental paradigm shift that upends the world order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 1972, the General Social Survey has periodically asked whether people are happy with Yes, Maybe or No type answers. Here I use a net “happiness” measure, which is percentage Yes less percentage No with Maybe treated as zero.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Average happiness is around +20 on this scale for all respondents from 1972 to the last pre-pandemic survey (2018). However, there is a wide gap of around 30 points between married and unmarried respondents.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>This “marital premium” is this paper’s subject. I describe how this premium varies across and within population groups. These include standard socio demographics (age, sex, race education, income) and more. I find little variety and thereby surface a notable regularity in US socio demography: there is a substantial marital premium for every group and subgroup I analyze, and this premium is usually close to the overall 30-point average.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>This holds not just for standard characteristics but also for those directly related to marriage like children and sex (and sex preference). I also find a “cohabitation premium”, but it is much smaller (10 points) than the marital premium. The analysis is mainly visual, and there is inevitably some interesting variety across seventeen figures, such as a 5-point increase in recent years.</p>

        <div class="blog-post-content markdown-content" style="text-align: justify;">
          
          
          <p>I need to sit down and combine some of these thoughts into a coherent piece but for now, I just want to dump  it all here for reference later. I doubt any of these are original and I have certainly seen some elsewhere.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Market structure for LLM makers may end up being like the airline market. High fixed cost to set up, hard to create a product differentiation that users care about (other than price), lots of competitors entering, at least in part due to the &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; of owning one. Lots of utility for consumers but hardly any profit for producers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An LLM with an infinite context window, one that can contain all my life, will be an entirely different product than an LLM with a limited context window. You can never have enough when it comes to context windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding 1, &ldquo;personality&rdquo; makes a huge difference in the experience of working with an LLM and the ability to create the right one could determine whether a model can dominate a market or a niche. Claude Sonnet 3.5 absolutely had than special sauce in my experience. We need a lot more of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://x.com/thestalwart/status/1894704594535551334?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This.</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t see how we’re going to avoid a situation where the internet become lousy with AI-created, pseudo academic writing filled with made up facts and quotes, which will then get cemented into “knowledge” as those articles become the training fodder for future models.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But combine it with the fact that if we all start getting our answers from LLMs, the online content &amp; ad based <a href="https://x.com/a16z/status/1892612797948952863" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business model goes caput</a> and then what is the incentive for people to put up good content on the web? None.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But anyone who has good proprietary, verified, high-quality data &amp; content will potentially control the value for the customer even as base LLMs become a commodity. Therefore does more data and content start going behind the paywall? If it doesn&rsquo;t it becomes training data and cannot be monetized.</p>

<p>What struck me was this bit in the report:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In a 2012 interview with Complex magazine, she recalled a scene in the 2006 film “Beautiful Ohio,” starring William Hurt and Rita Wilson, that featured her “naked tush.” It was, she said, “probably one of the most horrendous moments of my life.”</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It would take an army — or Martin Scorsese — to ever get me naked again,” she added.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As a viewer, I almost never think about the person behind the character. Sure if a Christian Bale loses nearly 30kg for a role, its visible enough and stark enough that one is forced to think about the how of it. But for the most part, I watch the program and move on. Maybe if there is something really interesting or shocking, a comment to my SO.</p>
<p>So it is a jarring to see that the impact of a brief scene stuck with the actor for years after the fact.</p>
<p>These days there is enough nudity on screen that most of us are desensitized to seeing it and I hope the actors are too, to performing them. Even in 2006 or 2012, when maybe it was less common, I would not have imagined an actor, and especially an American<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> actor, would be so traumatized by such a scene.</p>
<p>Maybe it is because she grew up in a time when that was a much bigger deal that it was harder on her. Perhaps actors like her were the trailblazers and paid a price and it is easier for actors now.</p>
<p>It is, however, possible to imagine a possibility where being naked on screen is traumatizing, no matter how common and acceptable. According to Claude, the &ldquo;being naked in public&rdquo; dream genre is common across cultures and age groups and more common in adoloscents.</p>
<p>If that is the case I shudder to imagine the cost of all the content on Netflix and other services in a few years time.</p>
<p>The report also has a bit on another scene she was not happy about. And guess what? At the time (and thankfully no longer), the report carried a photo from that scene.</p>

  <p>For the best travel experiences you need either a lot of money, or a lot of time. Of the two modes, it is far better to have more time than money. Although it tries, money cannot buy what time delivers. You have enough time to attend the rare festival, to learn some new words, to understand what the real prices are, to wait out the weather, or to get to that place that takes a week in a jeep. Time is the one resource you can give yourself, so take advantage of this if you are young without money.</p>

  <p>I have been building so many small products using LLMs. It has been fun, and useful. However, there are pitfalls that can waste so much time. A while back a friend asked me how I was using LLMs to write software. I thought “oh boy. how much time do you have!” and thus this post.</p>

  <p>I think Grok 3 came in right at expectations, so I don&rsquo;t think there is much to update in terms of consensus projections on AI: <strong>still accelerating development, speed is a moat, compute still matters, no obvious secret sauce to making a frontier model if you have talent &amp; chips.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone in 2035 should be able to marshall the intellectual capacity equivalent to everyone in 2025; everyone should have access to unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine. There is a great deal of talent right now without the resources to fully express itself, and if we change that, the resulting creative output of the world will lead to tremendous benefits for us all.</p>
