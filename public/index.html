(NYT)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The video is just under two and a half minutes long. A slim man with close-cropped hair walks into a room, pulls a long black mamba — whose venom can kill within an hour — from a crate and allows it to bite his left arm. Immediately after, he lets a taipan from Papua New Guinea bite his right arm. “Thanks for watching,” he calmly tells the camera, his left arm bleeding, and then exits.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Over nearly 18 years, the man, Tim Friede, 57, injected himself with more than 650 carefully calibrated, escalating doses of venom to build his immunity to 16 deadly snake species. He also allowed the snakes — mostly one at a time, but sometimes two, as in the video — to sink their sharp fangs into him about 200 times.</p>

  <p>Have the child. Practice the religion. Found the school. Support the local theater, the museum, the opera or concert hall, even if you can see it all on YouTube.

<blockquote>
  <p>New York can be expensive, overwhelming and intimidating, and sometimes it is hard for people to connect. A martini can cost $25 in a bar that’s too noisy for conversation, and raucous nightclubs aren’t for everyone. So a free, monthly B.Y.O.B. (bring your own board game) night in an office building food court has become a big hit.</p>

  <p>In addition to Werewolf, people were playing classics, like chess and mahjong, but also relatively newer games, including Catan, Splendor, Hues and Cues, Saboteur, Nertz, Wavelength, Blokus and Camel Up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Board game events and clubs have grown in popularity in recent years — in New York and across the country. This one is organized by Richard Ye, a 24-year-old who works in finance. He bills the event as New York City’s largest board game meet-up, and a video of Mr. Ye celebrating his March gathering — where 500 people were in attendance — was widely shared on social media.</p>

Despite the click-baity headline and not the most objective tone, the scientific brekthrough here is worth cheering.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Called in ovo sexing, it determines the sex of the chick embryo long before it hatches, allowing the producers to get rid of the male eggs and hatch only the females.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is important because:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I had no idea that while the Ladies enjoyed shelter and sunshine, fresh bugs and freedom, their newborn brothers faced a gruesome fate shared by 6.5 billion male chicks around the world each year. These male birds can’t lay eggs but also aren’t raised for meat. Because they come from egg-laying breeds, they don’t grow big or fast enough to be used for food. So they are ground up alive or gassed to death.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Australian Radio Network (ARN), the media company behind KIIS, as well as Gold and iHeart, used an AI-generated female Asian host to broadcast 4 hours of midweek radio, without disclosing it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This probably still will:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It seems very odd that CADA hired a new ethnically-diverse woman to their youth station and then just forgot to tell anyone.”</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>It’s notable because ARN is the whitest thing in media since the Night King and his throng of walkers on Game of Thrones. The network is also home of Australia’s most expensive, complained about and censured radio show, Kyle and Jackie O.</p>

  <p>“Penn Station is first and foremost a transportation hub,” said Aaron Donovan, the deputy communications director for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “But you know, as long as folks abide by the rules and regulations that govern the use of the space and don’t block platforms or interfere with passenger flows, we generally don’t have any problem with what’s going on.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, this is really fun. Watching the model’s thought process as it churns through the photo, pans and zooms and discusses different theories about where it could be is wildly entertaining. It’s like living in an episode of CSI.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>It’s also deeply dystopian. Technology can identify locations from photographs now. It’s vitally important that people understand how easy this is—if you have any reason at all to be concerned about your safety, you need to know that any photo you share—even a photo as bland as my example above—could be used to identify your location.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/texas-lottery-gamblers-jackpot-win-40e3d6fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How &ldquo;The Joker&rdquo; Took Down The Texas Lottery (WSJ Paywall)</a>: What a story. There is plenty of alpha out there, if you know where and how to look. Also, brute force is underrated. Sadly behind a paywall and there&rsquo;s lot more to it than the gist below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In Texas, as in many states, most people who play the lottery go to a store with a machine, choose numbers, then walk away with a ticket. Back in 2023, Texas also allowed online lottery-ticket vendors to set up shops to print tickets for their customers.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Marantelli’s team recruited one such seller, struggling startup Lottery.com, to help with the logistics of buying and printing the millions of tickets. Like all lotto retailers, it would collect a 5% sales commission. The Texas Lottery Commission allowed dozens of the terminals that print tickets to be delivered to the four workshops set up by the team.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>That April 19, the commission announced that there had been no winner in that day’s drawing. The next drawing, with an even larger pot, would be three days later, on a Saturday. The group sprang into action.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The printing operation ran day and night. The team had converted each number combination into a QR code. Crew members scanned the codes into the terminals using their phones, then scrambled to organize all the tickets in boxes such that they could easily locate the winning numbers.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The game called for picking six numbers from 1 to 54. For a pro gambler, some sets of numbers—such as 1,2,3,4,5,6—aren’t worth picking because so many other players choose them, which would split the pot. Marantelli’s operation bought 99.3% of the possibilities.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Money moved to Lottery.com from Ranogajec’s accounts—held under the name John Wilson—in the Isle of Man, a tax haven off the U.K. coast, taking a circuitous route via an escrow account at a Detroit law firm, according to people familiar with the transfers and bank statements reviewed by the Journal.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The crew hit the jackpot that Saturday. One of their tickets was the sole winner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are other reasons to build a Moon computer, including to avoid the regulatory hurdles to build the energy centers needed to power centralized AI clusters and as a sovereignty play in the increasingly fraught geopolitical game on the road to developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—a system with the ability to solve virtually any cognitive task a human can. We of, course, don’t have to mine the Moon just to replicate a single human mind, but we might have to do so to power superintelligence, same in kind but vastly superior to our own.</p>

  <p>The assistant is called Stevens, named after the butler in the great Ishiguro novel Remains of the Day. Every morning it sends a brief to me and my wife via Telegram, including our calendar schedules for the day, a preview of the weather forecast, any postal mail or packages we’re expected to receive, and any reminders we’ve asked it to keep track of. All written up nice and formally, just like you’d expect from a proper butler.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Beyond the daily brief, we can communicate with Stevens on-demand—we can forward an email with some important info, or just leave a reminder or ask a question via Telegram chat.</p>

  <p>After a fair bit of experimentation, I&rsquo;ve built a Claude project that handles all the repeatable high-effort prompt engineering (like source selection) for you.

<p>Two high-value excerpts from <a href="https://www.twitter.com/johnauthers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Authers</a> Bloomberg newsletters:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here follows a crowd-sourced literary tip. I asked yesterday for recommendations on great detective franchises for easy reading in stressful times, and you delivered. I’ve had so many suggestions that this will need to come in installments.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>To start, the name you’ve recommended most often, and with greatest enthusiasm, is <strong>Michael Connelly</strong> and his Harry Bosch series (the detective loves jazz and lives in the LA hills).</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Other entrants includes the Dave Robicheaux series by <strong>James Lee Burke</strong> (set in Louisiana and starting with The Neon Rain), <strong>Arnaldur Indridason’s</strong> “really good, bleak Icelandic stuff” (try Jar City first). <strong>Volker Kutscher’s</strong> Babylon Berlin series, set in Weimar Germany. <strong>Robert van Gulik’s</strong> Judge Dee stories (written some decades ago and set in Ancient China — try Willow Pattern).  Also the Martin Beck books set in 1960-70s Sweden and written over 10 years by <strong>Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo</strong> — a husband and wife team, and godparents of Scandinavian noir (Roseanna is recommended) and the Harry Hole books by <strong>Jo Nesbo</strong>, set in Norway.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>To be clear, I didn’t mention <strong>Raymond Chandler’s</strong> Marlowe books because I’ve already read all of them. If you’ve never dipped into Chandler, you have a treat in store — perhaps start with The Big Sleep. And as more than one of you said Connelly was as good as Chandler, I definitely want to read one of his. I’ll have plenty more suggestions tomorrow. Please, if you have any more to recommend, let me know.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Herewith another installment in our crowd-sourced tour of great detective fiction franchises. You might want to try: <strong>Abir Mukherjee’s</strong> Wyndham and Banerjee series is set in India under the British Raj; the Canadian writer <strong>Eric Wright’s</strong> John Salter series, set in Toronto; <strong>Philip Kerr’s</strong> Bernie Gunther series, set in Nazi Germany; the Whitstable Pearl mysteries by <strong>Julie Wassmer</strong> (who used to be a scriptwriter for Eastenders so there are plenty of cliffhangers); <strong>Andrea Camilleri’s</strong> Inspector Montalbano series, featuring Sicily and plenty of great food; and Death of a Red Heroine, the first of the Inspector Chen series by <strong>Qiu Xiaolong</strong> in contemporary Shanghai. This comes highly recommended by Andy Rothman of Sinology, long one of my favorite guides to all things China, and by remarkable coincidence I had picked up a copy of this book from a neighborhood bookshelf earlier this week. So that’s what I’ll read next. More detectives next week.</p>

  <p>The first generation of AI-powered products (often called “AI Wrapper” apps, because they “just” are wrapped around an LLM API) were quickly brought to market by small teams of engineers, picking off the low-hanging problems. But today, I’m seeing teams of domain experts wading into the field, hiring a programmer or two to handle the implementation, while the experts themselves provide the prompts, data labeling, and evaluations.</p>

          <p>After a few more iterations with Claude, the website is looking a lot better but it isn&rsquo;t working that much better. The Archives link on top right throws up a poorly formatted page.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The huge, black  &ldquo;Approved Thoughts&rdquo; at the top of the page and the smaller blue version in the header are redundant.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> There are many other issues to be fixed.</p>
<p>I also managed to get the CMS set up so that I could login and see all the posts in the CMS.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It is useless though because the posts I create there do not show up on the site. So there is some solid debugging needed before I can get more ambitious here. Still I am quite chuffed that I have this set up and working.</p>
<p>Between the markets and a potential relocation, I have not devoted any time to this website. Hopefully that changes soon.</p>

Wonder how much of the coventional wisdom today falls in this category.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Two weeks after his birth, Jeffrey’s health took a turn for the worse: He developed a heart defect common in premature infants – patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA. Jeffrey was scheduled for open-heart surgery and transferred to the nearest children’s hospital.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>In those days, surgery for PDA was invasive. Holes were cut on either side of Jeffrey’s tiny neck and chest to insert a catheter into his jugular vein. His little body was opened from breastbone to backbone, his flesh lifted aside, ribs pried apart, and a blood vessel near his heart tied off, and then all the tissues were stitched back together.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Baby Jeffrey felt everything – every incision, every internal repair, every stitch. The medical team had not given their fragile patient any drugs, any comfort, anything to protect him from the excruciating pain of open-heart surgery – just a paralyzing agent to keep him still during the procedure.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Five weeks later, Jeffrey passed away.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the days before her child’s death, Jill Lawson learned a shocking fact: Anesthetizing babies for surgery was not common practice. After Jeffrey died, Lawson called his doctor for reassurance. Surely, she thought, her child had been given something for the pain.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The anesthesiologist informed me that she had not used any anesthesia or analgesia on Jeffrey,” Lawson wrote in an account of her son’s experience. The doctor told the grieving mother it hadn’t even occurred to her to do so because it had never been demonstrated that babies can feel pain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have very wide error bars on the potential future of large language models, and I think you should too.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if, in three to five years, language models are capable of performing most (all?) cognitive economically-useful tasks beyond the level of human experts.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>And I also wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if, in five years, the best models we have are better than the ones we have today, but only in “normal” ways where costs continue to decrease considerably and capabilities continue to get better but there&rsquo;s no fundamental paradigm shift that upends the world order.</p>

<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5148219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Anatomy of Marital Happiness</a> via <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/03/the-anatomy-of-marital-happiness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since 1972, the General Social Survey has periodically asked whether people are happy with Yes, Maybe or No type answers. Here I use a net “happiness” measure, which is percentage Yes less percentage No with Maybe treated as zero.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Average happiness is around +20 on this scale for all respondents from 1972 to the last pre-pandemic survey (2018). However, there is a wide gap of around 30 points between married and unmarried respondents.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>This “marital premium” is this paper’s subject. I describe how this premium varies across and within population groups. These include standard socio demographics (age, sex, race education, income) and more. I find little variety and thereby surface a notable regularity in US socio demography: there is a substantial marital premium for every group and subgroup I analyze, and this premium is usually close to the overall 30-point average.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>This holds not just for standard characteristics but also for those directly related to marriage like children and sex (and sex preference). I also find a “cohabitation premium”, but it is much smaller (10 points) than the marital premium. The analysis is mainly visual, and there is inevitably some interesting variety across seventeen figures, such as a 5-point increase in recent years.</p>
