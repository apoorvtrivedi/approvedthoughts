A lot of NYT links today. For all its flaws, of which there might be many, the NYT is incomparable. 
1. Good advice from [Ross Douthat](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/extinction-technology-culture.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&sgrp=c&pvid=C1873161-08B0-4007-9849-B340D5D3C3C7): 
    > Have the child. Practice the religion. Found the school. Support the local theater, the museum, the opera or concert hall, even if you can see it all on YouTube. Pick up the paintbrush, the ball, the instrument. Learn the language — even if there’s an app for it. Learn to drive, even if you think soon Waymo or Tesla will drive for you. Put up headstones, don’t just burn your dead. Sit with the child, open the book, and read.

2. [Or play a boardgame?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/nyregion/new-york-city-giant-game-night.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&sgrp=c&pvid=664EA55A-E2EC-45AA-83DA-09E940368115):
    > New York can be expensive, overwhelming and intimidating, and sometimes it is hard for people to connect. A martini can cost $25 in a bar that’s too noisy for conversation, and raucous nightclubs aren’t for everyone. So a free, monthly B.Y.O.B. (bring your own board game) night in an office building food court has become a big hit.

    >In addition to Werewolf, people were playing classics, like chess and mahjong, but also relatively newer games, including Catan, Splendor, Hues and Cues, Saboteur, Nertz, Wavelength, Blokus and Camel Up.

    >Board game events and clubs have grown in popularity in recent years — in New York and across the country. This one is organized by Richard Ye, a 24-year-old who works in finance. He bills the event as New York City’s largest board game meet-up, and a video of Mr. Ye celebrating his March gathering — where 500 people were in attendance — was widely shared on social media.

3. [What I Didn’t Know About the Egg Industry Horrified Me](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/eggs-chicken-in-ovo-sexing.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&sgrp=c&pvid=95177B9E-C2E0-4AD3-8687-16818497ABBA): As a life-long vegetarian who can't even imagine turning vegan, I try to avoid evangelizing about what people should eat. Despite the click-baity headline and not the most objective tone, the scientific brekthrough here is worth cheering. 
    > Called in ovo sexing, it determines the sex of the chick embryo long before it hatches, allowing the producers to get rid of the male eggs and hatch only the females.

    This is important because: 

    >I had no idea that while the Ladies enjoyed shelter and sunshine, fresh bugs and freedom, their newborn brothers faced a gruesome fate shared by 6.5 billion male chicks around the world each year. These male birds can’t lay eggs but also aren’t raised for meat. Because they come from egg-laying breeds, they don’t grow big or fast enough to be used for food. So they are ground up alive or gassed to death.


4. [Questions about the Future of AI](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/questions-about-ai) by Dwarkesh Patel: I haven't read most of this but what I have is great. 

5. [Another important question about AI](https://velvetshark.com/ai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes) by Radek Sienkiewicz
: Why do AI company logos look like buttholes? Click the link. They really do.

6. [In a year will this still make news?](https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/eye-thy-with-my-ai-australian-radio-network-digitises-diversity-with-an-artificially-generated-asian-female-presenter/):
    > Australian Radio Network (ARN), the media company behind KIIS, as well as Gold and iHeart, used an AI-generated female Asian host to broadcast 4 hours of midweek radio, without disclosing it.

    This probably still will: 

    > “It seems very odd that CADA hired a new ethnically-diverse woman to their youth station and then just forgot to tell anyone.”

    > It’s notable because ARN is the whitest thing in media since the Night King and his throng of walkers on Game of Thrones. The network is also home of Australia’s most expensive, complained about and censured radio show, Kyle and Jackie O. 


7. [Penn Station’s Not-So-Secret Other Life: The People’s Dance Studio](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/arts/dance/penn-station-dancers.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&sgrp=c&pvid=0AC58D8E-9275-47B9-985B-BA17C9DF0E0E): 
    > “Penn Station is first and foremost a transportation hub,” said Aaron Donovan, the deputy communications director for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “But you know, as long as folks abide by the rules and regulations that govern the use of the space and don’t block platforms or interfere with passenger flows, we generally don’t have any problem with what’s going on.”

8. [Watching o3 guess a photo’s location is surreal, dystopian and wildly entertaining](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/o3-photo-locations/#atom-everything) by Simon Willison: 
    > First, this is really fun. Watching the model’s thought process as it churns through the photo, pans and zooms and discusses different theories about where it could be is wildly entertaining. It’s like living in an episode of CSI.

    > It’s also deeply dystopian. Technology can identify locations from photographs now. It’s vitally important that people understand how easy this is—if you have any reason at all to be concerned about your safety, you need to know that any photo you share—even a photo as bland as my example above—could be used to identify your location.
