1. [Unintentionally hilarious](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2025/greenland-trump-defense-russia-china/): 


   > The Danish Defense Ministry also plans to fund two more dogsled teams to protect the 375,000-square-mile Northeast Greenland National Park, the largest in the world. These would be the hardcore Sirius patrols, viewed by the Danes as the Navy SEALs of the Arctic, which began operations during World War II.


   Two. Not one.
2. [How to vibe code?](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1903672057327452290): A fairly decent app and when you see his conversations with ChatGPT, its mostly just plain english. Does a programming background help. Sure, but you can go quite far without any. Here are the actual conversations: 


   a. [Starting the app](https://t.co/TMyPAK2RhZ) 


   b. [Enhancements](https://t.co/vWnkwMrMe8)


   c. [More enhancements](https://t.co/NVxc7p1uVH)


   d. [Deploy to iPhone](https://t.co/e4xo4cmcWR)


   e. [The actual App](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1903891179370123559)
3. [Why we ended up homeschooling](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/why-we-ended-up-homeschooling):


   > TL;DR: homeschooling makes it much easier to individualize education, which makes it more efficient and meaningful.
4. [Tokyo vs. Rest of Japan](https://x.com/simongerman600/status/1904057096208839040): 


   > This is called the sponge city effect in my little world of demographics. In a declining region we often see the biggest city soaking up population since jobs and health services etc cluster in a single area rather than spreading out. Japan has been shrinking for three decades while Tokyo happily grows.
5. [How Much Would You Need to be Paid to Live on a Deserted Island for 1.5 Years and Do Nothing but Kill Seals?](https://mattlakeman.org/2020/07/10/how-much-would-you-need-to-be-paid-to-live-on-a-deserted-island-for-1-5-years-and-do-nothing-but-kill-seals/): What it says on the label. 
6. [Best take](https://x.com/maxwelltani/status/1904208683573161991): 


   > people are rightfully upset about this atlantic story because it gets at a truly alarming issue: being added to large, ongoing group texts without consent


   ðŸ˜‚


7. [True that!](https://x.com/DylanoA4/status/1902357203857616932): 
    > Your brain will invent fake problems for you if you don't go out and find real ones
