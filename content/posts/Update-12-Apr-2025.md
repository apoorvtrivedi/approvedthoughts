After a few more iterations with Claude, the website is looking a lot better but it isn't working that much better. The Archives link on top right throws up a poorly formatted page.[^1] The huge, black  "Approved Thoughts" at the top of the page and the smaller blue version in the header are redundant.[^2] There are many other issues to be fixed. 

I also managed to get the CMS set up so that I could login and see all the posts in the CMS.[^3] It is useless though because the posts I create there do not show up on the site. So there is some solid debugging needed before I can get more ambitious here. Still I am quite chuffed that I have this set up and working. 

Between the markets and a potential relocation, I have not devoted any time to this website. Hopefully that changes soon. 

I have also decided another project I want to try my hand at. More as I get started. 

**Thought for the day:** If you ask "do I feel like doing this now", you won't do it. Certainly not regularly. First, figure out how to stop the question. 

[^1]: This is now fixed. 
[^2]: This is also now fixed, although I am not sure if it is an improvement. 
[^3]: This was almost fixed but broke again and I have given up for now. When on the road, I can add posts directly via GitHub so, I am good for now.
