1. [You Sent the Message. But Did You Write It?](https://davidduncan.substack.com/p/you-sent-the-message-but-did-you?triedRedirect=true): Hilarious.

    >  **Chatcident**: When someone slips and pastes the prompt into the chat or email instead of the polished AI output – exposing the wizard behind the curtain.

2. [Points for kills: How Ukraine is using video game incentives to slay more Russians](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraines-army-have-video-game-like-digital-weapons-store-deadly-realistic/): 
    > Ukraine's military is turning to incentive schemes used in video games to spur its soldiers to kill more Russian troops and destroy their equipment.

    > The program — called Army of Drones bonus — rewards soldiers with points if they upload videos proving their drones have hit Russian targets. It will soon be integrated with a new online marketplace called Brave 1 Market, which will allow troops to convert those points into new equipment for their units.

3. [How far are you from India, measured in units of India?](https://x.com/TerribleMaps/status/1914641635566067808): I really need to update the site to show Tweets inline or at least display images. Hope Claude is up to the task. 

4. [This Is the Moment for Mexican Indian Food to Flourish (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/dining/mexican-indian-food-fusion.html): A marriage made in heaven. Literally. 

    > A small, close-knit Mexican Indian American community formed outside Sacramento when a generation of Punjabi Sikh and Muslim men immigrated from India to find work as farmers and loggers beginning in the late 1800s. After the Immigration Act of 1917 made it near impossible for Indian women to immigrate, hundreds of these men married Mexican women. New kinds of cooking emerged from their idiosyncratic home kitchens and a handful of restaurants the families went on to run.

    > On Sunday morning, as Holly LaFavers was preparing to go to church, a delivery worker dropped off a 25-pound box of lollipops in front of her apartment building in Lexington, Ky.

    >And another. And then another. Soon, 22 boxes of 50,600 lollipops were stacked five boxes high in two walls of Dum-Dums. That was when Ms. LaFavers heard what no parent wants to hear: Her child had unwittingly placed a massive online order.

    >“Mom, my suckers are here!” said her son, Liam, who had gone outside to ride his scooter.

    >“I panicked,” Ms. LaFavers, 46, said. “I was hysterical.”
