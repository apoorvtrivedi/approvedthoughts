1. [Digital hygiene](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene/) by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/): I discovered this just a little late to include in the last weeks post, where it would have been the perfect companion piece along with [this one](https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/) on getting phished. 

    I practice some of these recommendations already and wholeheartedly recommend the password manager, for example. I use [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/), which is about $60 a year if you want to sync across devices, but there are many free tools out there. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) offers all the essential features, including syncing across devices, for free and the paid versions are cheaper too. 

    I plan to explore his solutions for credit cards [(privacy.com)](https://www.privacy.com/) this weekend. Work-life separation is also great advice, which I did not follow in the past but am doing at my new(ish) job. 

2. Flight to [unkown destinations](https://x.com/therealmissjo/status/1908932089418031387). Would you take one? Doesn't seem like a big deal to me. As a reply to the tweet says, unlikely they will put you in a war zone, so if it is in Schengen, how bad could it be? I am probably clueless...

    > Scandinavian Airlines are running “unknown” destination flights. 

    >You buy a ticket and board the plane. Then you find out where you are going. 

    >Would you do it?

3. [Kim Shin-jo, 82, Failed North Korean Assassin, Dies as Pastor in the South (NYT Paywall)
](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/world/asia/kim-shin-jo-dead.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&sgrp=c&pvid=6A4371A3-97EE-4AED-951D-F9A61945C709): What a story and what a life! And [this story](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-dec-26-et-choe26-story.html) is straight out of hollywood, but without the happy ending. 

4. [Getting the Most from Deep Research Models](https://open.substack.com/pub/lawsen/p/getting-the-most-from-deep-research?):
    >After a fair bit of experimentation, I've built a Claude project that handles all the repeatable high-effort prompt engineering (like source selection) for you. It asks for your preferences, clarifies what you need, and produces a well-structured prompt that you can then feed into any DR model.

5. Two high-value excerpts from [John Authers](https://www.twitter.com/johnauthers) Bloomberg newsletters: 
    > Here follows a crowd-sourced literary tip. I asked yesterday for recommendations on great detective franchises for easy reading in stressful times, and you delivered. I’ve had so many suggestions that this will need to come in installments. 
    
    >To start, the name you’ve recommended most often, and with greatest enthusiasm, is **Michael Connelly** and his Harry Bosch series (the detective loves jazz and lives in the LA hills). 
    
    >Other entrants includes the Dave Robicheaux series by **James Lee Burke** (set in Louisiana and starting with The Neon Rain), **Arnaldur Indridason’s** “really good, bleak Icelandic stuff” (try Jar City first). **Volker Kutscher’s** Babylon Berlin series, set in Weimar Germany. **Robert van Gulik’s** Judge Dee stories (written some decades ago and set in Ancient China — try Willow Pattern).  Also the Martin Beck books set in 1960-70s Sweden and written over 10 years by **Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo** — a husband and wife team, and godparents of Scandinavian noir (Roseanna is recommended) and the Harry Hole books by **Jo Nesbo**, set in Norway.

    >To be clear, I didn’t mention **Raymond Chandler’s** Marlowe books because I’ve already read all of them. If you’ve never dipped into Chandler, you have a treat in store — perhaps start with The Big Sleep. And as more than one of you said Connelly was as good as Chandler, I definitely want to read one of his. I’ll have plenty more suggestions tomorrow. Please, if you have any more to recommend, let me know.


    > Herewith another installment in our crowd-sourced tour of great detective fiction franchises. You might want to try: **Abir Mukherjee’s** Wyndham and Banerjee series is set in India under the British Raj; the Canadian writer **Eric Wright’s** John Salter series, set in Toronto; **Philip Kerr’s** Bernie Gunther series, set in Nazi Germany; the Whitstable Pearl mysteries by **Julie Wassmer** (who used to be a scriptwriter for Eastenders so there are plenty of cliffhangers); **Andrea Camilleri’s** Inspector Montalbano series, featuring Sicily and plenty of great food; and Death of a Red Heroine, the first of the Inspector Chen series by **Qiu Xiaolong** in contemporary Shanghai. This comes highly recommended by Andy Rothman of Sinology, long one of my favorite guides to all things China, and by remarkable coincidence I had picked up a copy of this book from a neighborhood bookshelf earlier this week. So that’s what I’ll read next. More detectives next week.

6. [Drew Breunig](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/04/10/the-domain-experts-are-drivers.html) via [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/10/drew-breunig/#atom-everything):

    >The first generation of AI-powered products (often called “AI Wrapper” apps, because they “just” are wrapped around an LLM API) were quickly brought to market by small teams of engineers, picking off the low-hanging problems. But today, I’m seeing teams of domain experts wading into the field, hiring a programmer or two to handle the implementation, while the experts themselves provide the prompts, data labeling, and evaluations.

    >For these companies, the coding is commodified but the domain expertise is the differentiator.

7. [S Anand](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/): A great website from a college senior. On campus he was know as Stud Anand.
