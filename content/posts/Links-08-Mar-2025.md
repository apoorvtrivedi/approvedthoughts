1. [James Harrison: The Man Who Saved 2.4 Million Babies](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4xqe60gyo): Hall of Fame. 
2. Coincidentally, this week both [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/03/games-we-played.html) and [Karthik S](https://open.substack.com/pub/noenthuda/p/card-games?r=3a7g0&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false) shared memories of playing card games as kids. And then today my sister mentioned my younger newphew had started playing Dungeons and Dragons recently. We have played card games and board games with our boys, especially during COVID and it was fun. Clearly we should do more of this.  
3. [Another entry](https://x.com/dudespostingws/status/1895853031851544801?s=48) to the hall of fame. A different hall, sure, but come one, clearly this guy is a legend.  
4. A [different](https://x.com/davidbessis/status/1821170663832383918) [way](https://x.com/davidbessis/status/1813247439765401612) of learning math? Via [Zvi](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/childhood-and-education-9-school), who belongs in a third hall. Can't fault him for lacking ambition but perhaps this is the rare tweet that should have been an article. 
5. [A Cheeto Shaped Like the Pokemon Charizard Sells for Nearly $90,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/style/charizard-cheeto-pokemon-auction.html). NYT Paywall but do you really need to read anything else?
6. [Honey on a razor blade](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/as-sweet-as-razor-blade-honey?): Something about the actual visualization struck a chord with me.
