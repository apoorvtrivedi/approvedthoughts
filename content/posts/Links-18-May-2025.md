1. [How to make money betting on the new Pope](https://x.com/domahhhh/status/1920612517631479984): Great discussion of the betting process. Still plenty of luck involved but a reminder that there is plenty of "alpha" out there if you look in the right place. Maybe I should create a hashtag for these stories. #alpha
    > A few minutes later, my jaw dropped as Prevost -- the guy I had just amasssed shares in at 200-1 like 20 minutes earlier-- walked out onto the balcony as Pope.

2. [On the NBA and economic theory](https://x.com/Afinetheorem/status/1922471157569057117): Solving the problem of late season tanking to get a shot at the draft lottery in the NBA. Quite simple when you think about it. 
    > Optimal mechanism: get points for each loss. In game 1, a loss is worth 1 Draft Point. As season continues, loss is worth less, becoming negative late. Draft position based on Draft Points. Everyone wants to win late in season. Early season used to handicap truly bad teams.

3. [Populism is not popular. Success is popular.](https://scottsumner.substack.com/p/populism-is-not-popular): 
    > And Singapore is well run precisely because it adopts “unpopular” technocratic policies like zero tariffs, forced saving, and congestion pricing.

    And the PAP keeps getting re-elected, not despite, but because of those unpopular policies. Playing the long game, succesfully, since 1965. 

4. [Harvard Paid $27 for a Copy of Magna Carta. Surprise! It’s an Original.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/europe/harvard-magna-carta-original.html): To be fair it was $27 in 1946 dollars, but still. #alpha
    > Professor Carpenter was at home in Blackheath, south east London, plowing his way through Harvard Law School’s digital images as research for a book when he opened a file named HLS MS 172 — the catalog name for Harvard Law School Manuscript 172.

    > “I get down to 172 and it’s a single parchment sheet of Magna Carta,” he said. “And I think ‘Oh my god, this looks to me for all the world — because I read it — like an original.’”

    > Professor Carpenter emailed Professor Vincent, who was, at the time, at work in a library in Brussels. “David sent it with a message saying, ‘What do you think that is?’” said Professor Vincent. “I wrote back within seconds, saying, ‘You and I both know what that is!’”


    I would not have answered like that. 

A light week on links as it was a heavy week in life.
