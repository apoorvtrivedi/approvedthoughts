        <p>A long list today because this week two of my top sources were on fire - <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MR</a> and <a href="https://nytimes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYT</a>. </p>
<ol>

Well... maybe heartbreaking. No need to click the link though, the title says it all. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-cases-europe-americas-skyrocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Measles cases in Europe, the Americas skyrocket</a>: This is infuriating for two reasons. The second reason is that you wouldn&#39;t know it from reading most news that Europe has 10x the cases of USA. NYT I can understand, but I had to scroll down 3 pages on BBC website, after searching for &quot;measles&quot; to find a story about something other than RFK Jr. and Texas moms.</p>

Also apparently they wrinkle to improve underwater grip, not because the skin expands by absorbing water, which would have been hypothesis. </p>

No one has found it yet. This is the only clue.</a> It was found within a day of this post, so clearly the only thing holding back the search was the number of eyes looking. How many other problems is this true for? </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1925144465120870524" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&quot;One of main goals in life has been to make my parents proud&quot;</a>. 92% in Iraq, 78% in India. I remember realizing sometime in my early 30s that my parents didn&#39;t know the hierarchy of success in my field. As far as they were concerned I was already successful after college and any &quot;actual&quot; success wouldn&#39;t register with them. I felt the void in my movtivation for quite some time. Having your own kids helps with the transition. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://x.com/Econ_4_Everyone/status/1925172995481362619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI &amp; Critical Thinking</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An interviewer just asked me what skills AI will make more important. My response? Critical thinking skills. </p>



<p>This is because in the past there was value in creating large quantities of information. That is now costless. The new currency is how to generate, assimilate, interpret, and make that large amount of information actionable. </p>



<p>The next question then becomes how do we teach, and improve our own, critical thinking skills? I discuss that in a <a href="https://t.co/8V26lIjLxa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> where I create a critical thinking skills hierarchy.  </p>

<li><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/the-agentic-web-and-original-sin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Agentic Web and Original Sin</a>: I have been wondering about this problem for a while - who puts up the content for the LLMs to train on if everyone gets their answers from the chatbots and doesn&#39;t visit websites anymore. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem, as both I and Patel noted, is that this ecosystem depends on humans seeing those webpages, not impersonal agents impervious to advertising, which destroys the economics of ad-supported content sites, which, in the long run, dries up the supply of new content for AI. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> A potential solution: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the protocol layer should have a mechanism for payments via digital currency, i.e. stablecoins. Second, AI providers like ChatGPT should build an auction mechanism that pays out content sources based on the frequency with which they are cited in AI answers. The result would be a new universe of creators who will be incentivized to produce high quality content that is more likely to be useful to AI, competing in a marketplace a la the open web; indeed, this would be the new open web, but one that operates at even greater scale than the current web given the fact that human attention is a scarce resource, while the number of potential agents is infinite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the welfare effects of surge pricing? Using Uber data, I develop an empirical model of spatial equilibrium composed of demand, supply, and matching. I find that surge pricing raises total welfare, benefitting riders but hurting drivers.</p>



<p>Welfare effects differ substantially across sides of the market: rider surplus increases by 3.57% of gross revenue, whereas driver surplus and the platform’s current profits decrease by 0.98% and 0.50% of gross revenue, respectively. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense. If it hurts the platform or the drivers, why would they do it? </p>
<p>After dropping the pearl of wisdom above, I decided to actually read <a href="https://t.co/DQTiI1ytXI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a>. In the first two pages I found this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uber’s current profits decrease by 0.50% of gross revenue. This probably does not mean that Uber is hurt, but rather that it is willing to forgo current profits to increase rider surplus—the right choice if it believes that long-run shareholder value is more closely tied to rider surplus and customer retention than to current profits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes sense. After this my eyes glazed over and I dropped the paper in Claude and asked it why drivers would participate in this. Here&#39;s what it says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> The paper acknowledges this is the more problematic finding. &quot;My findings suggest that drivers might have good reason to complain. Their hourly earnings are not much higher than the minimum wage, so even the small effects I find might be a concern.&quot; </p>



<p>However, drivers may not have full information about the counterfactual (uniform pricing), and many drivers are part-time workers using Uber for supplemental income rather than as their primary employment.</p>

</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Sunday morning, as Holly LaFavers was preparing to go to church, a delivery worker dropped off a 25-pound box of lollipops in front of her apartment building in Lexington, Ky.</p>



<p>And another. And then another. Soon, 22 boxes of 50,600 lollipops were stacked five boxes high in two walls of Dum-Dums. That was when Ms. LaFavers heard what no parent wants to hear: Her child had unwittingly placed a massive online order.</p>



<p>“Mom, my suckers are here!” said her son, Liam, who had gone outside to ride his scooter.</p>



<p>“I panicked,” Ms. LaFavers, 46, said. “I was hysterical.”</p>

(NYT)</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The video is just under two and a half minutes long. A slim man with close-cropped hair walks into a room, pulls a long black mamba — whose venom can kill within an hour — from a crate and allows it to bite his left arm. Immediately after, he lets a taipan from Papua New Guinea bite his right arm. “Thanks for watching,” he calmly tells the camera, his left arm bleeding, and then exits.</p>



<p>Over nearly 18 years, the man, Tim Friede, 57, injected himself with more than 650 carefully calibrated, escalating doses of venom to build his immunity to 16 deadly snake species. He also allowed the snakes — mostly one at a time, but sometimes two, as in the video — to sink their sharp fangs into him about 200 times.</p>

<p>Have the child. Practice the religion. Found the school. Support the local theater, the museum, the opera or concert hall, even if you can see it all on YouTube. Pick up the paintbrush, the ball, the instrument. Learn the language — even if there’s an app for it. Learn to drive, even if you think soon Waymo or Tesla will drive for you. Put up headstones, don’t just burn your dead. Sit with the child, open the book, and read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New York can be expensive, overwhelming and intimidating, and sometimes it is hard for people to connect. A martini can cost $25 in a bar that’s too noisy for conversation, and raucous nightclubs aren’t for everyone. So a free, monthly B.Y.O.B. (bring your own board game) night in an office building food court has become a big hit.</p>



<p>In addition to Werewolf, people were playing classics, like chess and mahjong, but also relatively newer games, including Catan, Splendor, Hues and Cues, Saboteur, Nertz, Wavelength, Blokus and Camel Up.</p>



<p>Board game events and clubs have grown in popularity in recent years — in New York and across the country. This one is organized by Richard Ye, a 24-year-old who works in finance. He bills the event as New York City’s largest board game meet-up, and a video of Mr. Ye celebrating his March gathering — where 500 people were in attendance — was widely shared on social media.</p>

<p> This is important because: </p>

<p>I had no idea that while the Ladies enjoyed shelter and sunshine, fresh bugs and freedom, their newborn brothers faced a gruesome fate shared by 6.5 billion male chicks around the world each year. These male birds can’t lay eggs but also aren’t raised for meat. Because they come from egg-laying breeds, they don’t grow big or fast enough to be used for food. So they are ground up alive or gassed to death.</p>

There is plenty of alpha out there, if you know where and how to look. Also, brute force is underrated. Sadly behind a paywall and there&#39;s lot more to it than the gist below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Texas, as in many states, most people who play the lottery go to a store with a machine, choose numbers, then walk away with a ticket. Back in 2023, Texas also allowed online lottery-ticket vendors to set up shops to print tickets for their customers.</p>



<p>Marantelli’s team recruited one such seller, struggling startup Lottery.com, to help with the logistics of buying and printing the millions of tickets. Like all lotto retailers, it would collect a 5% sales commission. The Texas Lottery Commission allowed dozens of the terminals that print tickets to be delivered to the four workshops set up by the team.</p>



<p>That April 19, the commission announced that there had been no winner in that day’s drawing. The next drawing, with an even larger pot, would be three days later, on a Saturday. The group sprang into action.</p>



<p>The printing operation ran day and night. The team had converted each number combination into a QR code. Crew members scanned the codes into the terminals using their phones, then scrambled to organize all the tickets in boxes such that they could easily locate the winning numbers. </p>



<p>The game called for picking six numbers from 1 to 54. For a pro gambler, some sets of numbers—such as 1,2,3,4,5,6—aren’t worth picking because so many other players choose them, which would split the pot. Marantelli’s operation bought 99.3% of the possibilities.</p>



<p>Money moved to Lottery.com from Ranogajec’s accounts—held under the name John Wilson—in the Isle of Man, a tax haven off the U.K. coast, taking a circuitous route via an escrow account at a Detroit law firm, according to people familiar with the transfers and bank statements reviewed by the Journal.</p>



<p>The crew hit the jackpot that Saturday. One of their tickets was the sole winner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are other reasons to build a Moon computer, including to avoid the regulatory hurdles to build the energy centers needed to power centralized AI clusters and as a sovereignty play in the increasingly fraught geopolitical game on the road to developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—a system with the ability to solve virtually any cognitive task a human can. We of, course, don’t have to mine the Moon just to replicate a single human mind, but we might have to do so to power superintelligence, same in kind but vastly superior to our own.</p>

All written up nice and formally, just like you’d expect from a proper butler.</p>



<p>Beyond the daily brief, we can communicate with Stevens on-demand—we can forward an email with some important info, or just leave a reminder or ask a question via Telegram chat.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital hygiene</a> by <a href="https://karpathy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrej Karpathy</a>: I discovered this just a little late to include in the last weeks post, where it would have been the perfect companion piece along with <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> on getting phished. </p>
<p> I practice some of these recommendations already and wholeheartedly recommend the password manager, for example. I use <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dashlane</a>, which is about $60 a year if you want to sync across devices, but there are many free tools out there. <a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitwarden</a> offers all the essential features, including syncing across devices, for free and the paid versions are cheaper too. </p>
<p> I plan to explore his solutions for credit cards <a href="https://www.privacy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(privacy.com)</a> this weekend. Work-life separation is also great advice, which I did not follow in the past but am doing at my new(ish) job. </p>

As a reply to the tweet says, unlikely they will put you in a war zone, so if it is in Schengen, how bad could it be? I am probably clueless...</p>

<p>You buy a ticket and board the plane. Then you find out where you are going. </p>



<p>Would you do it?</p>

<p>After a fair bit of experimentation, I&#39;ve built a Claude project that handles all the repeatable high-effort prompt engineering (like source selection) for you. It asks for your preferences, clarifies what you need, and produces a well-structured prompt that you can then feed into any DR model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here follows a crowd-sourced literary tip. I asked yesterday for recommendations on great detective franchises for easy reading in stressful times, and you delivered. I’ve had so many suggestions that this will need to come in installments. </p>



<p>To start, the name you’ve recommended most often, and with greatest enthusiasm, is <strong>Michael Connelly</strong> and his Harry Bosch series (the detective loves jazz and lives in the LA hills). </p>



<p>Other entrants includes the Dave Robicheaux series by <strong>James Lee Burke</strong> (set in Louisiana and starting with The Neon Rain), <strong>Arnaldur Indridason’s</strong> “really good, bleak Icelandic stuff” (try Jar City first). <strong>Volker Kutscher’s</strong> Babylon Berlin series, set in Weimar Germany. <strong>Robert van Gulik’s</strong> Judge Dee stories (written some decades ago and set in Ancient China — try Willow Pattern).  Also the Martin Beck books set in 1960-70s Sweden and written over 10 years by <strong>Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo</strong> — a husband and wife team, and godparents of Scandinavian noir (Roseanna is recommended) and the Harry Hole books by <strong>Jo Nesbo</strong>, set in Norway.</p>



<p>To be clear, I didn’t mention <strong>Raymond Chandler’s</strong> Marlowe books because I’ve already read all of them. If you’ve never dipped into Chandler, you have a treat in store — perhaps start with The Big Sleep. And as more than one of you said Connelly was as good as Chandler, I definitely want to read one of his. I’ll have plenty more suggestions tomorrow. Please, if you have any more to recommend, let me know.</p>



<p>Herewith another installment in our crowd-sourced tour of great detective fiction franchises. You might want to try: <strong>Abir Mukherjee’s</strong> Wyndham and Banerjee series is set in India under the British Raj; the Canadian writer <strong>Eric Wright’s</strong> John Salter series, set in Toronto; <strong>Philip Kerr’s</strong> Bernie Gunther series, set in Nazi Germany; the Whitstable Pearl mysteries by <strong>Julie Wassmer</strong> (who used to be a scriptwriter for Eastenders so there are plenty of cliffhangers); <strong>Andrea Camilleri’s</strong> Inspector Montalbano series, featuring Sicily and plenty of great food; and Death of a Red Heroine, the first of the Inspector Chen series by <strong>Qiu Xiaolong</strong> in contemporary Shanghai. This comes highly recommended by Andy Rothman of Sinology, long one of my favorite guides to all things China, and by remarkable coincidence I had picked up a copy of this book from a neighborhood bookshelf earlier this week. So that’s what I’ll read next. More detectives next week.</p>

<p>The first generation of AI-powered products (often called “AI Wrapper” apps, because they “just” are wrapped around an LLM API) were quickly brought to market by small teams of engineers, picking off the low-hanging problems. But today, I’m seeing teams of domain experts wading into the field, hiring a programmer or two to handle the implementation, while the experts themselves provide the prompts, data labeling, and evaluations.</p>



<p>For these companies, the coding is commodified but the domain expertise is the differentiator.</p>
