<p>What struck me was this bit in the report: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a 2012 interview with Complex magazine, she recalled a scene in the 2006 film ‚ÄúBeautiful Ohio,‚Äù starring William Hurt and Rita Wilson, that featured her ‚Äúnaked tush.‚Äù It was, she said, ‚Äúprobably one of the most horrendous moments of my life.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIt would take an army ‚Äî or Martin Scorsese ‚Äî to ever get me naked again,‚Äù she added.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a viewer, I almost never think about the person behind the character. Sure if a Christian Bale loses nearly 30kg for a role, its visible enough and stark enough that one is forced to think about the how of it. But for the most part, I watch the program and move on. Maybe if there is something really interesting or shocking, a comment to my SO. </p>
<p>So it is a jarring to see that the impact of a brief scene stuck with the actor for years after the fact. </p>
<p>These days there is enough nudity on screen that most of us are desensitized to seeing it and I hope the actors are too, to performing them. Even in 2006 or 2012, when maybe it was less common, I would not have imagined an actor, and especially an American<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> actor, would be so traumatized by such a scene. </p>
<p>Maybe it is because she grew up in a time when that was a much bigger deal that it was harder on her. Perhaps actors like her were the trailblazers and paid a price and it is easier for actors now. </p>
<p>It is, however, possible to imagine a possibility where being naked on screen is traumatizing, no matter how common and acceptable. According to Claude, the &quot;being naked in public&quot; dream genre is common across cultures and age groups and more common in adoloscents.  </p>
<p>If that is the case I shudder to imagine the cost of all the content on Netflix and other services in a few years time. </p>
<p>The report also has a bit on another scene she was not happy about. And guess what? At the time (and thankfully no longer), the report carried a photo from that scene.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
        <p>I need to sit down and combine some of these thoughts into a coherent piece but for now, I just want to dump  it all here for reference later. I doubt any of these are original and I have certainly seen some elsewhere. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Market structure for LLM makers may end up being like the airline market. High fixed cost to set up, hard to create a product differentiation that users care about (other than price), lots of competitors entering, at least in part due to the &quot;prestige&quot; of owning one. Lots of utility for consumers but hardly any profit for producers. </p>
</li>
<li><p>An LLM with an infinite context window, one that can contain all my life, will be an entirely different product than an LLM with a limited context window. You can never have enough when it comes to context windows. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding 1, &quot;personality&quot; makes a huge difference in the experience of working with an LLM and the ability to create the right one could determine whether a model can dominate a market or a niche. Claude Sonnet 3.5 absolutely had than special sauce in my experience. We need a lot more of it. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://x.com/thestalwart/status/1894704594535551334?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This.</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt see how we‚Äôre going to avoid a situation where the internet become lousy with AI-created, pseudo academic writing filled with made up facts and quotes, which will then get cemented into ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù as those articles become the training fodder for future models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> But combine it with the fact that if we all start getting our answers from LLMs, the online content &amp; ad based <a href="https://x.com/a16z/status/1892612797948952863" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business model goes caput</a> and then what is the incentive for people to put up good content on the web? None.</p>
</li>
<li><p>But anyone who has good proprietary, verified, high-quality data &amp; content will potentially control the value for the customer even as base LLMs become a commodity. Therefore does more data and content start going behind the paywall? If it doesn&#39;t it becomes training data and cannot be monetized.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>For the best travel experiences you need either a lot of money, or a lot of time. Of the two modes, it is far better to have more time than money. Although it tries, money cannot buy what time delivers. You have enough time to attend the rare festival, to learn some new words, to understand what the real prices are, to wait out the weather, or to get to that place that takes a week in a jeep. Time is the one resource you can give yourself, so take advantage of this if you are young without money.</p>

<p>...we now have evidence that in real-world use it can do something that has never been seen before: twice-yearly injections in thousands of female trial volunteers in high-risk areas (South Africa and Uganda) showed a one hundred per cent prevention rate of HIV infection.    </p>

<p> This fits with my experience. But also for doing &quot;real&quot; work, prompt engineering matters. Giving the right instructions in the right order does make a difference.  </p>
<p> See more scepticism <a href="https://x.com/getjonwithit/status/1892054184146411878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this thread</a>. Along with some of the comments I am hearing Satya Nadella made in his <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast with Dwarkesh</a>, I wonder if we are seeing a vibe shift on AI?</p>

<p>I have been building so many small products using LLMs. It has been fun, and useful. However, there are pitfalls that can waste so much time. A while back a friend asked me how I was using LLMs to write software. I thought ‚Äúoh boy. how much time do you have!‚Äù and thus this post.</p>

<p>I think Grok 3 came in right at expectations, so I don&#39;t think there is much to update in terms of consensus projections on AI: <strong>still accelerating development, speed is a moat, compute still matters, no obvious secret sauce to making a frontier model if you have talent &amp; chips.</strong>  </p>

<p> Anyone in 2035 should be able to marshall the intellectual capacity equivalent to everyone in 2025; everyone should have access to unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine. There is a great deal of talent right now without the resources to fully express itself, and if we change that, the resulting creative output of the world will lead to tremendous benefits for us all.</p>

3. [Wisdom II](https://x.com/gergelyorosz/status/1887813676972851577): A lot of AI cheerleading takes [this form](https://ghuntley.com/dothings/). Yes, you can just do things. I have also thought and posted along those lines. But as Gergely points out, the hard thing in building a payment system is not the code - its fraud, AML, KYC, tax, reporting, reconcilliation...
    
<pre><code>That is true for most other hard things too. The hard thing in pharma is not finding the compound but getting the trials and approvals done. The hard thing in politics in not the manifesto but the consensus.

<blockquote>
<p>This is me with my dad, Bill White. For decades, he has been an evangelical pastor. Before I was born, he wrote a letter to my future wife. He didn‚Äôt know what we both do now: that I‚Äôm gay. When I came out nearly 16 years later, it shook his faith and fractured his church. But it never separated us. I wanted to understand how. So I read his journals.</p>

<p>I am happy to ‚Äúconcede‚Äù that if you face a choice between saving a stranger and saving your brother, save your brother!

I‚Äôll ‚Äúconcede‚Äù all of this, immediately, because it‚Äôs all fake; none of your relatives were ever in any danger. The only point of this whole style of philosophical discussion is so that you can sound wise as you say ‚ÄúAh, but is not saving your brother more important than saving a complete stranger?‚Äù then sentence five million strangers to death for basically no benefit while your brother continues to be a successful real estate agent in Des Moines.</p>
